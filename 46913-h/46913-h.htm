<p class="break p4 x-large center">EGHOLM AND HIS GOD</p>




<h2 class="nobreak">I</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Sivert stands leaning his elbows on the window
ledge, digging all ten fingers into his curly hair,
and looking down at the muddy court below.</p>

<p>Not a soul.</p>

<p>He looks at the wet roofs, and the raindrops
splashing tiny rings in the water all along the gutter.</p>

<p>Not so much as a sparrow in sight. Only the
sullen November drizzle, flung now and then into
gusts, and whipping the panes with a lash of rain.</p>

<p>But that is enough for Sivert. He looks out into
the grey desolation, highly amused at it all.</p>

<p>Now he purses up his lips and whispers something,
raises his eyebrows, mutters something in reply, and
giggles.</p>

<p>Let him, for Heaven’s sake, as long as he can,
thinks his mother.</p>

<p>And Sivert finds it more amusing still. Wonderful,
so much there is going on inside him. He shakes
his poodle mop of hair, and gives way to a long-drawn,
gasping laugh&mdash;simply can’t help it&mdash;leans his forehead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
against the pane, thrusts both hands suddenly
deep into his pockets, and gives a curious wriggle.</p>

<p>“You great big boy, what’s the matter now?”
says his mother gently.</p>

<p>Sivert turns his head away and answers with an
evasive laugh:</p>

<p>“All that rain ... it tickles so.”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm does not question him again; for a
moment she really feels as if the boy were right.
And, anyhow, it would be no use asking him. If only
he can find his little pleasure in it, so much the better.</p>

<p>And there’s no saying how long ... Egholm had
said it was time the boy found something to do, now
he was confirmed. Find him a place at once. And
Sivert, poor weakly lad&mdash;how would it go with
him?</p>

<p>Fru Egholm shakes her head, and sends a loving
glance at the boy, who is plainly busy in his mind with
something new and splendid.</p>

<p>Then suddenly his face changes, as if at the touch
of death itself. His eyes grow dull, his jaw drops;
the childish features with their prematurely aged
look are furrowed with dread as he stares down at
something below.</p>

<p>“Is it Father?” she whispers breathlessly.
“Back already?”</p>

<p>She lays down her sewing and hurries to the
window; mother and son stand watching with
frightened eyes each movement of the figure below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm walks up from the gate, lithe and erect,
just as in the old days when he came home from the
office. But at every step his knees give under him,
he stumbles, and his wet cloak hangs uncomfortably
about him. At last he comes to a standstill, heedless
of the fact that his broad boots are deep in a puddle
of water.</p>

<p>Once he looks up, and Sivert and his mother hold
their breath. But the flower-pots in the window
hide them. His head droops forward, he stands
there still. A little after, they see him trudging
along close to the wall, past his own door.</p>

<p>The watchers stand on tiptoe, pressing their
temples against the cold glass, straining to see what
next.</p>

<p>Egholm stops at the Eriksens’ gate, glances round,
and kneels.</p>

<p>Kneels down full in the mire, while the gale
flings the cape of his ulster over his head. Now he
snatches off his hat and crushes it in his fingers; his
bald head looks queerly oblong, like a pumpkin, seen
from above.</p>

<p>“He’s praying!”</p>

<p>And the two at the window shudder, as if they
were witnessing some dreadful deed.</p>

<p>“Where am I to hide?” blubbers Sivert.</p>

<p>The mother pulls herself together&mdash;she must find
strength for two.</p>

<p>“You need not hide to-day. Take your little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
saw and be doing some work. You’ll see, it will be
all right to-day.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he counts the money?”</p>

<p>“Oh, heaven...!”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better tell him at once? Shout out
and tell him as soon as he comes in, and say Hedvig
took it?”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“Or go and kill ourselves?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Sit still, Sivert dear, and don’t say a
word. Maybe God will help us. We might put
something over the bowl ... no. Better leave it
as it is.”</p>

<p>Heavy steps on the stairs outside. Egholm walks
in, strong and erect again now.</p>

<p>He hangs up his wet things, and fumbles with a
pair of sodden cuffs.</p>

<p>“Didn’t get a place, I suppose?” asks his wife,
looking up from the machine. Sivert sits obediently
at a little table at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>“Is it likely?” Egholm’s face is that of one
suffering intensely. And he speaks in an injured
tone.</p>

<p>“I only thought.... You’re home earlier than
usual.”</p>

<p>No answer. Egholm walks over to the window
and stares into the greyness without, his long, thin
fingers pulling now and again at his dark beard.</p>

<p>Lost in thought....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>His wife does not venture to disturb him, though
he is shutting out the fading light. She keeps the
machine audibly in motion, making pretence of
work.</p>

<p>A long, long time he stands there. Sivert has been
sawing away conscientiously all the time, but at last he
can bear it no longer, and utters a loud sigh. Fru
Egholm reaches stealthily for the matches, and lights
the lamp. Her fingers tremble as she lifts the glass.</p>

<p>Egholm turns at the sound. And now he is no
longer Egholm the upright, nor Egholm the abject;
<em>Egholm the Great</em> he is now. His eyes glow like
windows in a burning house; he stands there filling
the room with Egholm; Egholm the invincible.
The mother cowers behind her sewing-machine; and
her seam runs somewhat awry.</p>

<p>What terrible thing can he be thinking of now?
The “Sect,” as usual?&mdash;Heaven have mercy on
them, now that Egholm has joined the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Surely something terrible must happen soon; he
has rarely been as bad as this before.</p>

<p>He moves, and his wife looks up with a start.
But now he has changed again, to something less
terrible now&mdash;not quite so deadly terrible as before.</p>

<p>He is far away in his dreamings now, without a
thought for his earthbound fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>He stands in his favourite attitude, with one
hand on his hip, as if posing to a sculptor. A fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
figure of a man. His watch-chain hangs in a golden
arc from one waistcoat pocket to the other. Only
one who knew of the fact would ever notice that
one of the oval links is missing, and a piece of string
tied in its place.</p>

<p>After a little he begins walking up and down, stopping
now and again at the window, with a gesture of
the hand, as if addressing an assembly without.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he swings round, facing his wife,
and utters these words:</p>

<p>“Now I know what it means. At last!”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm checks the wheel of her machine, and
looks up at him with leaden-grey, shadow-fringed
eyes. But he says no more, and she sets the machine
whirring once more.</p>

<p>Peace for a little while longer, at any rate, she
thinks to herself.</p>

<p>Sivert looks up stealthily every time his father
turns his back; the boy is flushed with repressed
excitement, the tip of his tongue keeps creeping
out.</p>

<p>“Mark you,” says Egholm after a long pause,
“I’m wiser perhaps&mdash;a good deal wiser&mdash;than you
take me for.”</p>

<p>He throws out his chest with conscious dignity,
lifting his head, and placing one hand on his hip as
before.</p>

<p>Oh, so he’s still thinking of that quarrel of theirs
this morning. Well, well, of course it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
something to do with the Brotherhood some way or
other.</p>

<p>“You said I was wasting my time.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“You said I was throwing money out of the
window.”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm shifts in her seat, pulling nervously
at her work. She would like to mitigate the sharpness
of her words, and yet, if possible, stand by what
she had said.</p>

<p>Sivert wakes to the fact that he is dribbling down
over his hand, and sniffs up hastily.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say it was throwing money out of
the window?”</p>

<p>“I said, it was hard taking money where there
was none.”</p>

<p>“You said it was throwing money away. But do
you know what I’m doing with that money all the
time? I’m putting it in the bank.”</p>

<p>“In the bank?...”</p>

<p>“In the <em>Bank of Heaven</em>&mdash;where the interest is a
thousand&mdash;nay, tens of thousands&mdash;per cent.! If it
wasn’t for that, I’d never have thought of joining the
Brotherhood at all.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I can’t help it, but I don’t believe in
him, that Evangelist man. Young Karlsen, I
mean.”</p>

<p>Egholm breathed sharply, and quickened his
steps. The answer did not please him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“You talk about young Karlsen: I am talking of
Holy Writ.”</p>

<p>“But it was Karlsen that....”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I shall thank him for it till my dying
day. He it was that opened my eyes, and showed
me I was living the life of one accursed; pointed out
the goal I can reach&mdash;cannot fail to reach&mdash;if only
I will pay my tithe. Do you know what it says in
Malachi? Shall I give you the words of Malachi
the Prophet?”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es ... if you please,” answers his wife
confusedly.</p>

<p>“Yes ... if you please,” echoes Sivert in precisely
the same tone. He has a painful habit of taking
up his mother’s words when anything excites him.</p>

<p>But Egholm had no time now to punish the
interruption; he stood forth and spoke, with
threatening sternness:</p>

<p>“‘<em>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me.
But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes
and offerings.</em>’</p>

<p>“‘<em>Ye are cursed with a curse....</em>’</p>

<p>“Cursed!” Egholm struck the table with his
fist in condemnation. “Do you hear? They are
accursed who would rob the Lord&mdash;<em>in tithes and
offerings!</em>”</p>

<p>“It’s solemn hard words,” said the mother, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>“No harder than it should be. Just and right!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was only thinking&mdash;the New Testament&mdash;perhaps
there might be something there to make it
easier.”</p>

<p>“Make it easier! God’s Law to be made
easier! Are you utterly lost in sin, woman? Or
do you think I would tamper with the Holy Scriptures?
Read for yourself&mdash;there!”</p>

<p>He snatched the old Bible from its shelf and flung
it down on the sewing-machine. Fru Egholm looked
at the thick, heavy tome with something like fear in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“I only meant ... if it was really God’s will
that we should starve to find that money for
Karlsen.”</p>

<p>“Starve&mdash;and what’s a trifle of starvation when
the reward’s so much the greater? What does it say
there, only a little farther on: ‘<em>Prove me now herewith,
saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the
windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that
there shall not be room enough to receive it</em>’?</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a glorious promise? Perhaps the
finest in the whole Bible. Are you so destitute of
imagination that you cannot see the Lord opening
the windows of heaven, and the money pouring out
like a waterfall, like a rainbow, over us poor worms
that have not room enough to receive it?”</p>

<p>“Money?&mdash;but it doesn’t say anything about
money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does&mdash;if you read it aright. It’s there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
all right, only”&mdash;Egholm drew his lips back a little,
baring his teeth&mdash;“only, of course, it needs a little
sense in one’s head to read the Bible, just as any
other book. It wasn’t all quite easy to me at
first, but now I understand it to the full. There’s
not a shadow of doubt, but the Bible means <em>ready
money</em>. What else could it be? The blessing of the
Lord, you say. Well, there’s more than one of the
Brethren in the congregation thinks the same&mdash;and
that’s what makes them slow in paying up <em>their</em>
tithes and offerings. They think the blessing is just
something supernatural; an inner feeling of content&mdash;fools’
nonsense! Do you suppose I could be
content, with duns and creditors tearing at me like
dogs about a carcase? No; ready money, that’s
what it means. Money we give, and money shall be
given unto us in return; we shall receive our own
with usury, as it is written.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean....”</p>

<p>Egholm grasped eagerly at the hint of admission
that he fancied lay behind her doubt. He strode to
the chest of drawers, and, picking up the crystal
bowl, held it out towards the light as if raising it in
salutation. The tithe-money showed like some dark
wine at the bottom.</p>

<p>“I swear unto you,” he said, with great solemnity,
“it is even so.”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm meets his burning glance, and is
confused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would be a grand thing, sure enough, if we
could come by a little money.” And she sighs.</p>

<p>“But it’s not a little,” says Egholm. The impression
he has made on her is reacting now with
added force upon himself. “Not altogether little;
no. I can feel it; there is a change about to come.
And a change, with me, must be a change for the
better. It means I am to be exalted. ‘Friend,
come up higher!’”</p>

<p>Again he strides up and down, seeking an outlet
for his emotion. He sets down the bowl, and picks
up the Bible instead, presses the book to his breast,
and slaps its wooden cover, shaking out a puff of
worm-eaten dust.</p>

<p>“Beautiful book,” he says tenderly&mdash;“beautiful
old book. By thee I live, and am one with thee!”
And, turning to his wife, he goes on: “After all, it’s
simple enough. If I do my duty by God, He’s got
to do His by me, and I’d like to see how He can get
out of it.”</p>

<p>There was a rattle of the door below. Fru
Egholm listened ... yes, it was Hedvig, coming
back from her work. There&mdash;wiping her boots on
Eriksens’ mat, the very thing she’d been strictly forbidden.
And dashing upstairs three steps at a time
and whistling like a boy. No mistaking Hedvig.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm signed covertly to Sivert to go out
in the kitchen. She could give the children their food
there, without being noticed. What you don’t hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
you don’t fear, as the saying goes. And that was true
of Egholm; it always irritated him when Sivert made
a noise over his food. Poor child&mdash;a good thing he’d
the heart to eat and enjoy it.</p>

<p>Hedvig came tumbling in, with a clatter of wooden
shoes.</p>

<p>“Puh, what a mess! I’m drenched to the skin.
Look!” She ducked forward, sending a stream of
water from the brim of her hat. Her hair, in two
heavy yellow plaits, slipped round on either side, the
ends touching the floor; then with a toss of her head
she threw it back, and stood there laughing, in the
full glare of the lamp.</p>

<p>Glittering white teeth and golden eyelashes.
The freckles round her nose gave a touch of boyishness
to her face.</p>

<p>“My dear child, what can we give you to put
on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll find some dry stockings&mdash;there’s a pair
of mine in the settee.”</p>

<p>“Sivert borrowed those, dear, last Sunday, you
know. But you can ask him&mdash;he’s outside in the
kitchen.”</p>

<p>Egholm, too, must have his meal. He had a
ravenous appetite. The pile of bread and dripping
vanished from his plate as a cloud passes from the
face of the moon. Possibly because he was reading,
as he ate, of the land of Canaan, a land flowing with
milk and honey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The rain spattered unceasingly against the panes.</p>

<p>“What are you hanging about here for?” asked
Hedvig. Sivert was standing huddled up by the
sink.</p>

<p>“He’ll find out in a minute,” whispered the
boy. “He’s waving his arms and legs about, and
talking all about money.”</p>

<p>“Puh&mdash;let him. We must eat, so there’s an end
of it. He’ll have forgotten by to-morrow how much
there was.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll count it to-night. He’s going to the
meeting.”</p>

<p>“To-night&mdash;h’m. That’s a nasty one,” said
Hedvig thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Sivert showed a strange reluctance to hand over
the stockings.</p>

<p>“They’ve been confirmed,” he explained. “I
wore them last Sunday. You can’t have them back
now after they’ve been to my confirmation. It’s a
great honour.”</p>

<p>“You take them off, and that sharp! You can
see mine are wet through.”</p>

<p>“Mine are ... they’re wet, too.”</p>

<p>“Wet, too? Why, what have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I couldn’t help it,” snivelled Sivert shamefacedly.
“It came of itself, when Father took the
bowl....”</p>

<p>Hedvig drew away from him, turning up her
nose in disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ugh! You baby!”</p>

<p>“Mother! Is she to call me a baby now I’m
grown up and confirmed?”</p>

<p>“Hold your noise, out there!” cried his father.
“Run down to Eriksens’ and ask the time.”</p>

<p>Sivert hurried away, and brought back word:
half-past seven.</p>

<p>“I must be off,” said Egholm, with an air of
importance.</p>

<p>Mother and children looked with a shiver of
dread towards the cut-glass bowl. But Egholm was
quietly putting on his still dripping coat, looking at
himself in the glass, as he always did. It was a game
of blind man’s buff, where all save the blind man
know how near the culprit stands.</p>

<p>“Leave out the key, Anna, if I’m not....”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be waiting up all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you like.” Egholm moved to the
door; he grasped the handle. A flicker of hope
went through them; he had forgotten his tithe
and offering. To-morrow it wouldn’t matter so
much....</p>

<p>But Egholm stood there still, pulling at his
beard, straining himself to think....</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;I mustn’t forget the chiefest of all.”</p>

<p>In the midst of a ghastly silence he took the bowl
from its place, shook out the little heap of coppers,
and with a satisfied air stacked them up in orderly
piles, ready to count. He counted all through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
counted over again, and moved the piles in different
order, pulled at his beard, and glowered. The
mother kept her eyes fixed on her work, but the
children were staring, staring at their father’s hands.</p>

<p>“How much was it he lent us on the clock last
time? Three <i>kroner</i>, surely?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think it was three,” said Fru Egholm,
trying her hardest to speak naturally.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?&mdash;‘you <em>think</em>  it was!’”
Her husband rose to his feet with a threatening
mien.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I remember now. It <em>was</em> three
<i>kroner</i>.”</p>

<p>“And did you put the thirty-<i>øre</i> tithe in the bowl,
as I ordered?”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm felt instinctively that it would be
best to insist that the money had been put in the
bowl. But another and stronger instinct led her
at this most unfortunate moment to hold forth in
protest against the giving of tithes at all, and more
especially tithe of moneys received on pawned
effects. And very soon she had floundered into a
slough of argument that led no way at all.</p>

<p>Egholm strode fuming up and down the room.</p>

<p>“You didn’t put it in at all.”</p>

<p>“I did. To the last <i>øre</i>.”</p>

<p>Now this was perfectly true. The money <em>had</em>
been put in....</p>

<p>“Then you must have stolen it again after.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“God wouldn’t have it, I know. It’s blood
money.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t He? He shall&mdash;I’ll see that He
does! You’ve stolen money from the Lord! What
have you done with it?”</p>

<p>“What do you think we should do with it?”</p>

<p>“Who’s been out buying things?” he thundered,
turning to the children.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t me&mdash;not quite,” said Sivert, with one
thumb deep in his mouth.</p>

<p>“That means it was you, you little whelp. What
did you buy with the money?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t buy two eggs.” Sivert was steadfastly
pleading not guilty.</p>

<p>Egholm called to mind that he had had an egg
with his dinner. The depth of villainy was clear
and plain.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm could hold out no longer. “I&mdash;I
thought you needed something strengthening,
Egholm; you’ve been looking so poorly. And I
took out the thirty <i>øre</i> again and bought two eggs.
One you had, and one I gave the children. They
need it, too, poor dears.”</p>

<p>Egholm felt his brain seething; he gripped his
head with both hands, as if fearing it might burst.
Every nerve seemed to shudder as at the touch of
glowing iron.</p>

<p>“<em>Ye are cursed with a curse</em>,” he said in a hollow
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Egholm, do be calm....” But his wife’s
well-meaning effort only made him the more furious.
He picked up his stick and struck the table with a
crash.</p>

<p>“You should be struck down and smitten to
earth&mdash;you have brought a curse upon my house!”</p>

<p>“Egholm, do be careful. It’s not for my own
sake I say it, but remember the state I’m in....”</p>

<p>“What have I to do with the state you’re in?” he
thundered inconsequently, but laid down his stick.
“Out with the money this minute! Do you hear?
The money, the money you took!”</p>

<p>“But you know yourself we used all we had for
the rent, or I wouldn’t have touched the other. I
can’t dig up money out of the ground.”</p>

<p>“Then give me the silver spoon.”</p>

<p>This was a little child’s spoon, worn thin, and
bearing the date of Fru Egholm’s christening.</p>

<p>“Take it, then,” she said, weeping.</p>

<p>The children had been looking on with frightened
eyes. Sivert, in his confusion, now began sawing
again.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;you dare&mdash;at such a time! Stop that
at once!” cried his father. And by way of securing
immediate obedience, he twined his fingers in the boy’s
hair and dragged him backwards out of his chair, till
his wooden shoes rattled against the flap of the table.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm sprang towards them; the linen she
was at work on tore with a scream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake!” she cried desperately,
picking up the boy in her arms.</p>

<p>“Give me the spoon and let’s have no more
nonsense,” said Egholm, and strode out. The three
stood listening, as to the echoes of retreating thunder.
First the slam of the door below, then the heavier
clang of the gate across the yard.</p>

<p>“O&mdash;oh!” said Hedvig, “he ought to be
<em>thrashed</em>!” And she drew a deep breath, as of
cleaner air.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak like that, child. After all, he’s
your father.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h2>II</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Egholm descended the stairs, each step
carrying him so much farther down from
the heights of his rage. By the time he had
crossed the stone paving, and let the street door
clang behind him, he was as gentle as any hermit of
the dale.</p>

<p>A gust of wind sent him staggering over to the
outflow of a gutter pipe, which greeted him with an
icy shower; he took it as one might take the jest of
a friend. What matter, either, that the same wind
thrust a chilly feeler in under his collar, right down
to the armhole, or slapped him flat-handed on the
mouth and left him breathless? He was not moved
to anger when the streams and puddles he was wading
through followed the law of nature and filled his
leaky boots within to the level of the waters without.
Meekly he pressed his hat more firmly down, bowed
his head submissively, and walked in all humility
close to the house walls, lest he should hinder the
wind in its task.</p>

<p>The tumult within him had subsided, leaving no
more than the ordinary eagerness of a man in a hurry&mdash;a
man intent on getting to a meeting in good time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Street after street, with the same wet breath in
his face. He crossed over Vestergade, where the
shop windows flared in a row on either side, and a
carriage on its way to the theatre nearly knocked
him down. Then he burrowed once more into the
side streets, emerging at last, by way of a narrow
passage, into a yard, where lights were burning in
the windows of a stable&mdash;a stable converted, being
now the hall and meeting-place of the Brethren of
St. John.</p>

<p>The unlighted entry gave out a thick smell of
mildew and plaster. Egholm felt a childish nervousness
as he realised that the meeting had already
begun. He smoothed his wreath of hair, and wiped
the water from his face with his cape; then, fumbling
for the handle of the door, he walked in.</p>

<p>The hall was half-full of people; young Karlsen
was standing on the stage, delivering a sort of homily.
This was young Karlsen’s usual opening, designed to
pass the time until old Karlsen could get away from
the shop. Everybody knew it, and all bore it
patiently, excepting young Karlsen himself, who
longed most earnestly for the hour of his deliverance.</p>

<p>At the sound of the door, he stooped and bent
forward, trying to see beneath the lamps and make
out who had come in. But he made no pause in his
sermon; only, his delivery became somewhat strained
and disconnected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>When the bald top of Egholm’s head caught the
light, however, he drew back with a jerk of disappointment,
yawned, thrust his hands resignedly
into his pockets, and went on:</p>

<p>“Consequently, my dear friends, as I have
said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Egholm stepped softly to a rickety seat, and
sheltered himself behind Fru Laursen’s ample figure.</p>

<p>The hall was not large, but all were heartily welcome
there. On Saturdays and Sundays its rotten
floor-boards shook beneath the feet of factory girls,
with high wooden heels, and lads from the slaughterhouse,
with neckties slipping up at the back. Both
parties sweated profusely as they danced, and mine
host from the dramshop across the courtyard sat on
an upturned box next the door uncorking bottled
beer.</p>

<p>On Wednesdays, from six to eight, a drill sergeant
fumed over a class of unpromising pupils from the
Peasant Welfare Schools, who walked, and on the
toes rose, and from the hips bent, as they were told,
yet never managing to attain that explosive <i>élan</i>
which alone maketh the heart of a drill sergeant to
rejoice.</p>

<p>When the Brethren of St. John arrived at eight,
the air would be foggy with chalk precipitated in
the sweat of peasant brows; it might even happen
that the “last four” were still gaspingly at work
dragging the vaulting-horse back into place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>For three hours, no more, the congregation of
Brethren held the hall in peace; a few minutes
past eleven, and figures uncouthly garbed thrust pale
but insistent faces in at the door. These were the
Histrionics&mdash;the Amateur Dramatic Society of the
Trade and Commercial Assistants’ Union, who with
true business talent had chosen Wednesday for their
rehearsals, in order to enjoy the warmth provided
beforehand by the Brethren. They were not interested
in other of the Brethren’s manifestations.
Any extension of the service or proceedings beyond
time limit would be greeted with whistlings, cat-calls,
and slamming of doors&mdash;while nothing could
exceed the eager politeness with which the waiting
Histrionics made way for the Brethren as they left.</p>

<p>The hall was further used as an auction room.
Egholm was often present on such occasions; he
had an inclination towards the feverish excitement
of the hammer.</p>

<p>Karlsen was still on his feet.</p>

<p>Egholm let his glance wander absently from the
ropes and trapeze to the ragged fringe of the stage
curtain, that waved in the draught like the fin of a
fish.</p>

<p>He was not an attentive listener; he freely admitted
that, when he came to the meetings, it was
not so much to hear the edifying speeches of the
“Evangelist,” as because the door to the treasury
of the Lord was here to be found. And the depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of faith in his heart&mdash;that was the key.... With a
sudden impulse, he felt in his pocket for the tithe-money.
Yes, thank Heaven, it was there.</p>

<p>Karlsen was taking an unpardonable time about
it this evening. There was an ever-recurring phrase
he used: “<em>Dear friends.</em>” He used it like the knots
in the climbing-rope that hung from the ceiling, as
something to rest on by the way. And there was
often quite an appreciable pause before he could spit
on his hands and go on. It was plain to see that his
speech would never carry him beyond the roof, but,
for all that, his face, bluely unshaven, and furrowed
with intercrossing wrinkles, showed a degree of
cunning as if he were solving a difficult problem, or
recounting the details of a complicated business
manœuvre.</p>

<p>Egholm knew that Karlsen had been a travelling
pedlar selling woollen goods from his pack along the
roads, before he turned Evangelist. And in some
ways, the tricks of his old trade clung to him yet. He
would hand out eternal truths as if it were a pair
of flannel unmentionables&mdash;pure wool, unshrinkable,
everlasting wear....</p>

<p>Having nothing now with which to occupy his
hands, the Evangelist thrust them in his pockets and
gesticulated with them under cover there. Now he
would clench his fist, till the pocket bulged as if
with a heavy revolver; now he would draw out his
breeches sideways like a concertina. And in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pauses he could be seen to scratch himself assiduously,
first with one hand, then with the other.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;at last he came to an end, and led the
singing from a little thin book.</p>

<p>The congregation livened up a little, with a clearing
of throats and shifting in seats. Half-way through
the hymn, the door was heard. The Evangelist
ducked down again to look, and when suddenly he
pulled his hands out of his pockets, all knew who it
was that had arrived.</p>

<p>Old Karlsen, the Evangelist’s father, was the eldest
of the flock, and holder of its highest dignity&mdash;that
of Angel.</p>

<p>Also, apart from his connection with the Brethren,
proprietor of a very paying little ironmongery
business.</p>

<p>Slowly he strode through the hall; the singing
faces turned towards him as he came. His black
clothes gave him an air of distinction; his silvery hair
and prophet’s beard were outward and visible signs of
holiness. It would be hard to imagine a figure more
suited in its dignity to the weighty name of Angel.</p>

<p>The only access to the stage was by way of three
beer cases set stairwise to its edge. But under the
footsteps of the prophet they were transformed to
golden steps of a ladder leading heavenward.</p>

<p>Young Karlsen murmured a few words, glanced
at his watch, and disappeared like one cast forth as
unworthy. And old Karlsen prayed with his earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
almost tearful voice for the welfare of the congregation.</p>

<p>Egholm was thrilled. This&mdash;this was surely
communion with the Lord.</p>

<p>The eyes of the prophet shone in the glare from
the footlights&mdash;or perhaps it was rather that he saw
God, as it had been promised to the pure in heart.</p>

<p>There came a sound of weeping from behind;
Egholm turned to see. It was Lystrup, the cobbler.
His flat, brown fingers clutched and curled convulsively,
and his bony head, with the queer feathery
hair, rocked to and fro, as he wept and moaned,
without covering his face.</p>

<p>The cobbler’s emotion spread to those around.
Within a second it had reached the hindmost bench,
where the old women from the almshouses sat. There
was a flutter of movement among the shawls, accompanied
by a low wailing. Egholm noticed with some
surprise that deaf old Maren was weeping with the
best. Evidently, the influence of Angel Karlsen
could manifest itself in other ways than that of
common speech.</p>

<p>Egholm was greatly moved; he withdrew his
gaze, and looked down at the floor as if in search
of something fixed and immovable. But Fru
Laursen’s back began to work, and soon her bulky
frame was slopping incontinently about in front
of him. Egholm felt an ache within him, something
comparable to hunger; he raised his eyes and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to see, through tears, great folded angel-wings
behind Karlsen’s back. This was too much; Egholm
surrendered himself utterly, and wept. And his
weeping was louder and more passionate than the
weeping of those about him; some there were who
ceased at the sound, and watched him.</p>

<p>Young Karlsen had planted himself against the
wall by the end of Egholm’s bench, and was enjoying
the effect. The wrinkles in the young apostle’s face
were ceaselessly at play, forming new and intricate
labyrinths without end. As soon as the Angel had
finished his prayer, young Karlsen slipped in close to
Egholm and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>“Straight to the heart,” he said admiringly.
“That’s the sort of goods, what? It fetches
them.”</p>

<p>Egholm dried his eyes bashfully.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to drive a lot like this. But”&mdash;a
sudden gleam of contempt shone in his blue-and-watery
sheep’s eyes&mdash;“it’s about the only thing he
can do. Angel, indeed! Once he’s got you here,
he’s good for something, I’ll allow. But who is it
fills the hall?&mdash;eh, young man? Who is it gets them
here to start with? Jutland and the half of Fyn,
that’s my district. I’m an Evangelist&mdash;a fisher of
men. And I’ve my little gift of tongues as well&mdash;and
need it, or the fishes wouldn’t bite as they do.</p>

<p>“Hear my little speech this evening? Not much
in it to speak of. But then I’d finished really, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the time you came. But I’ve got another on hand
that’ll do the trick. The Word, what?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Egholm accommodatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, you know yourself,” said the Evangelist,
with a little laugh, “for you were simply done for
when I began. You can’t deny it!”</p>

<p>“God’s own words&mdash;&mdash;” began Egholm.</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear good man, of course. But
who picked them out? God’s words, you say, but
there’s any amount of words; no end of words. The
thing is to pick out the right ones&mdash;just as you’d pick
out the right sort of bait for the right sort of fish.
God’s words&mdash;huh! The Bible’s like a pack of cards;
doesn’t mean anything till it’s been dealt round.”</p>

<p>Egholm spoke up at this. “I wouldn’t like,
myself,” he said, “to compare the Bible to a pack
of cards. But&mdash;as far as I know&mdash;I’d say there’s
no card to beat the ace of clubs.”</p>

<p>The Evangelist laughed heartily. “If spades
are trumps, a bit of a smudgy black knave’s enough
to do for your ace of clubs. There’s one coming
along this evening&mdash;I’ve been working on her for
over two years now, and all she cared for was the fear
of Hell. You’ve got to deal with them according
to their lights, and there’s a power of difference
sometimes. Now, you, for instance&mdash;you were easy
enough. Windows of heaven opening, that was
your line. Ho, I remember! Well, well, it’s all
the same, as long as....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Karlsen broke off in distraction every time the
door opened.</p>

<p>“As long as the Lord gets your souls. And
Father, he’ll see to that.”</p>

<p>Egholm began to feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The congregation had broken up into groups,
centring more particularly about the neighbourhood
of the Angel. Johannes, the postman, glared furiously,
with distended greenish eyes, at Fru Laursen wading
like a cow among the reeds.</p>

<p>“If I can keep behind her,” thought Egholm to
himself as he rose, “I might get through. Just to
thank him....”</p>

<p>“Thought it was her,” whispered Karlsen in his
ear.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>With a look of unspeakable cunning, Karlsen
brought his face closer, blinked his eyes, and
whispered again:</p>

<p>“A goldfish! And, on my word, the best we’ve
had up to now. The one I told you about before.”</p>

<p>Egholm forgot all else. “A lady, you mean?
Who? Coming to-night?”</p>

<p>“A lady, yes,” said Karlsen, almost stifling with
pride. “A real lady, and no fudge.” He made a
gesture that might have been mere helplessness.
“But whether she’ll come or not, well, time will
show.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>A little after, he lapsed into his natural dialect,
and said frankly:</p>

<p>“I’m simply bursting to see if she’ll come.”</p>

<p>“But who is it?” asked Egholm impatiently.</p>

<p>“Her name&mdash;is&mdash;Fru Westergaard!”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t mean&mdash;the Distillery?”</p>

<p>“Hundred thousand,” said Karlsen, patting an
imaginary pocket-book. “Widow of the late Distiller
Westergaard, yes!” Then suddenly he broke into
his platform tone, an imitation of Angel Karlsen’s
tear-stifled voice.</p>

<p>“Fru Westergaard’s soul was hungered and
athirst after Zion. And for two years past I’ve cried
aloud to her in the wilderness, making ready the way
before her&mdash;the way to the blessed Brotherhood of
St. John. And now, at last, my words have brought
forth fruit in her heart. Yes, and <em>I’ve been to the
villa!</em>”</p>

<p>He grasped Egholm’s hand and pressed it in a
long, firm grip&mdash;a way they had among the Brethren.</p>

<p>Again the door opened, but it was only Meilby,
the photographer. The Evangelist turned up his
nose in scorn, and looked another way.</p>

<p>Meilby was another uncommon figure in his
way. Here, among a congregation of contritely
stooping sinners, he walked as stiffly upright as a
well-drilled recruit. Even his eyes had nothing of
that humility which might be expected in the house
of the Lord, but looked about him sharply, as if in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
challenge, though ordinarily they were mildly blue
as a boy’s. What did he want here, night after
night? Was he drawn by some higher power, and
yet sought, like Saulus, to kick against the pricks?
Maybe. Egholm looked after him with a shake of the
head, as he tramped through the hall, shut his cigar-case
with a click, and seated himself irreverently on
the vaulting-horse.</p>

<p>Egholm often walked home with Meilby after
the meetings, but it was he who did the talking,
Meilby’s contributions rarely amounting to more
than a fretful “Heh,” “Haw,” or “Ho”&mdash;a kind
of barking, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>“D’you know Meilby at all?” asked Egholm.</p>

<p>Karlsen twirled one finger circlewise in front
of his forehead, but he had not time to explain himself
further; just at that moment Fru Westergaard
arrived.</p>

<p>She stopped just inside the door, and turned her
wet veil up over her eiderdown toque&mdash;a tall, thin
woman, with the angular movements of an old maid,
and clothes that looked as if she slept in them.</p>

<p>“Naughty, naughty dog! Outside, Mirre, Mirre,
do you hear!”</p>

<p>She faced round, and waved her dripping umbrella
at an eager poodle with its tongue hanging out.</p>

<p>“Here she is!” cried young Karlsen. And at
once the room was so still that the scraping of the
dog could be heard against the flooring. All mouths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stood open, as if in one long indrawn breath of
astonishment.</p>

<p>Still scolding under her breath, she walked with
some embarrassment a few steps forward. Young
Karlsen thrust Egholm aside, and hurried to meet
her with a bow.</p>

<p>“Dog’s all right,” he said, with reassuring ease
of manner. “Don’t bother about him. Late?
Not a bit of it; we’ve hardly begun. Just sitting
talking, heart to heart, you understand. Come
along in, both of you. Know me, doggy, don’t you,
eh?”</p>

<p>He bent down and ruffled the dog’s ears.</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he must have slipped out and followed me.
I’d no idea....”</p>

<p>Young Karlsen’s eyeballs rolled about, to see what
impression the lady made upon the congregation.
And he was not disappointed. If St. John the
Apostle, the traditional founder of the sect, had
appeared in their midst, it could hardly have created
a greater sensation.</p>

<p>Egholm had himself been something of a thunderbolt&mdash;an
ex-official of the railway service suddenly
appearing in this assembly of hunchbacked tailors
and lame shoemakers, relics from the almshouses,
and all that was worn out and faded&mdash;always excepting,
of course, the prosperous ironmonger at their
head. But Fru Westergaard was as an earthquake
that sent them flat on their faces at once. Not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
child in the town but knew her and her villa and her
dog, that took its meals with her at table.</p>

<p>Johannes, the postman, stood leaning against the
wall, helpless, as if in terror.</p>

<p>Madam<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Kvist, her eyes starting out behind her
glasses, asked aloud, in unaffected wonder:</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what in the name of mercy will she be
wanting here?”</p>

<p>And Madam Strand, the dustman’s wife, a little
black figure of a woman, was curtseying and mumbling
continually: “Such an honour, did you ever, such
an honour....”</p>

<p>Most of those present inwardly endorsed the
sentiment.</p>

<p>Egholm drew himself up and sought to catch
Fru Westergaard’s eye. He did not manage it, but
let off his bow all the same. Only the incorrigible
photographer sat swinging his legs on the vaulting-horse,
with an expression of cold disapproval on his
face.</p>

<p>Angel Karlsen stood by the three steps, ready,
like another St. Peter, to receive the approaching
soul. He took both the lady’s hands and pressed
them warmly.</p>

<p>“There’s rejoicing here on earth and in the
mansions of the Lord,” he said, with emotion, “at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the coming of this our new disciple.” When he
spoke, his great white beard went up and down, as
if emphasising his words.</p>

<p>“And now the usual word of thanksgiving. Sit
down here in front, <i>Frue</i>.”</p>

<p>The new disciple was still talking nervously about
the dog&mdash;it was leaving footmarks all over the place,
but then, you know, in such weather.... She had
galoshes for it, really, only to-night....</p>

<p>She moved to sit down, but the others rose
hurriedly as she did so, and the bench rocked.</p>

<p>No, no, she couldn’t sit there&mdash;no, not there; she
couldn’t. No....</p>

<p>Fru Westergaard allowed herself the luxury of
some eccentricities. She had remained unmarried
until her six-and-fortieth year.</p>

<p>Egholm had been prepared for the trouble about
the seat. Sprightly as a youth, he dashed out of the
hall and across the courtyard to the taproom in
front.</p>

<p>“A chair; lend me a chair, will you? Fru
Westergaard’s there.”</p>

<p>“Fru Westergaard!”</p>

<p>“Fru Westergaard!”</p>

<p>He came back, breathless, with an American
rocking-chair, which he proffered humbly.</p>

<p>The congregation had meanwhile arranged itself
in a phalanx formation like wild geese on the wing.
In the forefront of all sat the new disciple in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
restless chair. On the next bench were Evangelist
Karlsen and Egholm alone, and behind them again
came the rest of the dearly beloved, in order of precedence
according to dignity or ambition.</p>

<p>The entire flock seemed shaping its course towards
the sun, in the person of Angel Karlsen, who
was up on the platform praying and preaching,
tearful and affecting as ever.</p>

<p>“<em>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so
panteth my soul after Thee, O God.</em></p>

<p>“<em>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God;
when shall I come and appear before God?</em>”</p>

<p>He wrung his hands in a great agony, and hid his
face.</p>

<p>“<em>My tears have been my meat day and night....</em>”</p>

<p>Egholm was touched. He, too, knew what it was
to weep for meat.</p>

<p>Karlsen the Elder closed with the Lord’s Prayer;
and another hymn was sung.</p>

<p>“Now, it’s me again,” whispered the young
Evangelist. “You see me let her have it this time.”</p>

<p>His speech seemed actually to have gained force
and balance; there was an evident purpose in it.
The opening was weak, perhaps, for here he still
clung to his “Dear friends” from force of habit,
though every word was addressed to Fru Westergaard
only.</p>

<p>“And now, in conclusion, I thank you, my dear
friends, for coming here among us the first time. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
hope, dear friends, it may not be the last. In the
midst of all your wealth and luxury and manifold
delights out at the villa, you have yet felt the lack of
a word&mdash;the word of the Spirit. Yes, dear friends, it
is even so. You go to church and you go back home
again, and your need is not fulfilled.</p>

<p>“But then one day there comes to your door&mdash;out
at the villa&mdash;a poor Evangelist, an unlearned
man. And lo&mdash;a strange thing, dear friends&mdash;<em>he</em>
has the word&mdash;the word of the Spirit!”</p>

<p>Having thus laid down a flattering position for
himself, young Karlsen went on to praise his new
convert as one docile and of a good heart. She had
come this evening of all evenings&mdash;a first Wednesday&mdash;on
purpose that she might pay her tithe. No,
there was no drawing back. And in truth it would be
a fool’s game to try it on. The Lord, He could see
straight through a drawer in a table or the cover of
a bank-book, never fear of that. And what was
His, that He was going to have. Yes, that was His
way. And woe unto him that falleth into the hands
of the living God!</p>

<p>Far down by the door, old Karlsen was modestly
seated on the extreme end of a bench. In his lap
was a japanned tin box. There was a slight rattle
during the next hymn, as he took out his keys and
opened the casket.</p>

<p>The bench was so placed that the disciples could
only pass by in single file. The old women from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
almshouses, who had been sitting farthest back, were
now the first to pass. As a matter of fact, they were
exempt from the tithe contribution, having no
income beyond their food and lodging. But most
of them, nevertheless, managed to deposit a copper
two or five <i>øre</i> piece with the Angel as they went out,
though he never so much as looked up.</p>

<p>Why should he look? The money was not for
himself, but for God. He was only sitting there
holding the black tin box.</p>

<p>There was a clicking of purse-clips, and a soft
ring of coin. Lystrup, the cobbler, dropped his
money, and crawled miserably over the floor beneath
the benches, looking for that which was lost.</p>

<p>Those who had paid stopped behind to see
the others share their fate.</p>

<p>Fru Westergaard, Egholm, and the Evangelist
came down together.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but how do you manage when it doesn’t
work out exactly?” said the lady, nervously trying
to do sums in her head.</p>

<p>“It always works out exactly,” said Karlsen, with
superior calm.</p>

<p>“As long as it’s <i>kroner</i>, of course, I understand.
But when it’s <i>kroner and øre</i>?”</p>

<p>She gave it up as hopeless, and drew out a
crumpled book from the little bag she carried.</p>

<p>“Here you are; you can see. I get my money
from the bank, you know; it’s in a book like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm craned up on tiptoe. The Evangelist
wormed up closer, his face a curious mingling of
venom and sweetness; even old Karlsen thrust the
box under his arm and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“My spectacles!” And he slapped his pockets
so that the money rattled in the box.</p>

<p>Two hundred and sixty-six <i>kroner</i> thirty <i>øre</i>.</p>

<p>That was the figure that showed again and again
down the page in the cross-shaded columns, with
Fru Westergaard’s signature after. There was a
murmur from the waiting crowd.</p>

<p>“How much was it?”</p>

<p>“Eh, to think now! And every month!”</p>

<p>“Over two hundred and fifty, that is,” explained
Lystrup, the cobbler.</p>

<p>“That will be twenty-six <i>kroner</i> sixty-three to
us,” said the Evangelist, as if it were the merest trifle.</p>

<p>“Not sixty-three <i>øre</i>?&mdash;that can’t be,” said the
disciple energetically, looking round for support.</p>

<p>Egholm could not meet her eyes; it pained him
that Karlsen was so evidently right.</p>

<p>“But I only get thirty <i>øre</i>, and you say I’m to
pay out sixty-three! No, thank you, that’s trying
it on, I know.”</p>

<p>“It’s the law&mdash;it’s the law.” Old Karlsen
drummed on his box.</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t put up with it!” Fru Westergaard’s
grey cheeks flushed with a red spot.</p>

<p>“Not an <i>øre</i> less.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Karlsen stood planted in the opening
between the bench and the wall. He wore high
boots, with his trousers thrust into them, and stood
with his feet a little apart. There was something
ominous written, as it were, between the lines in
his face. His shoulders were slightly raised&mdash;a very
respectable pair of shoulders had young Karlsen.</p>

<p>Fru Westergaard tucked away her book again
with trembling hands.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll let me pass?”</p>

<p>“It’s twenty-six sixty-three, all the same,” said
the Evangelist, without moving an inch.</p>

<p>“I won’t give more than twenty-six thirty!”
She stamped her foot. Mirre growled softly, and
sniffed round and round Karlsen’s legs.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six sixty-three.”</p>

<p>“Sh!” old Karlsen intervened. “We’ll take
what <i>Fruen</i> thinks is right. The Lord is long-suffering....
Lauritz, you can be putting out the
corner lights.”</p>

<p>Thus did the Angel, by his wisdom and gentleness,
save one soul for the congregation of the
Brethren.</p>

<p>Fru Westergaard had, it appeared, the money
in a separate compartment of her bag, all ready
counted out. Handing them to Angel Karlsen, she
said:</p>

<p>“And you’re quite sure there’s no Hell, really?”</p>

<p>“No Hell....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Karlsen was standing on a bench, puffing
at one of the lights. He turned warningly towards
his father.</p>

<p>“No,” he cried. “That’s right. No Hell.
You know, we talked it over....”</p>

<p>Angel Karlsen bowed his head in silence, but
Fru Westergaard stared wildly before her.</p>

<p>“Hell, hell fire, all yellow flames....”</p>

<p>Egholm could contain himself no longer. He
would show the lady and the rest of them how a true
disciple settled up his accounts with God. With a
smile and a gesture as if he had been casting a rose
into his mistress’ lap, he flung his paper bag of money
into the Angel’s casket. The bag burst with the
shock, and the coins came twirling out; the old
man had to use both hands to guard them, and
could hardly close the box.</p>

<p>“Wait, there’s more yet!” cried Egholm, and
his voice broke. He held the silver spoon aloft
in two fingers, then pressed it in through the crack
at the lid of the box.</p>

<p>But the box was full to repletion, and the bowl
of the spoon would not go in.</p>

<p>Egholm felt there had never been so magnificent
an offering.</p>

<p>Yet another of the Brethren passed by that
strait place&mdash;Meilby, the photographer. Not one
single copper <i>øre</i> did he put in, but Angel Karlsen
only turned his eyes meekly to the other side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h2>III</h2>


<p class="firstpara">February had set in. Fru Egholm’s seventh
was making ever stronger demands on her
heart’s blood. While she toiled at her work,
the young citizen to come was pleased to kick about
occasionally, or turn over on the other side, making
her faint and dizzy. But, recovering, she would
smile, and whisper softly: “There there, now, bide
your time, little man.” She had her own convictions
that it was to be a boy.</p>

<p>Egholm stood in front of the mirror, smoothing
his wreath of hair. His pupil was due for the English
lesson.</p>

<p>“The Pupil” was a subject of considerable
importance in the house, especially to Egholm’s own
mind. It was no other than Meilby, the sharp-tongued
photographer, who had started taking
lessons in the previous November. After many
mysterious hints, and exacting a promise of silence,
he had confided to Egholm that he was going to
America in a few months’ time. Egholm had grabbed
at him avidly and without ceremony, as a chance of
work. Regarded as a pupil, he was by no means
promising. He had but the faintest conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of any difference between parts of speech such as
substantives and adjectives, and whenever his mentor
touched on genitives and possessives, he would
glance absently towards the door. Furthermore, he
never paid any fees, which was a subject of constant
tribulation between Anna and her husband.</p>

<p>“But it’s a good thing to have a little outstanding.
Like capital in the bank, against a rainy day.”</p>

<p>Anna made no answer to this. It seemed to her
mind that the days were rainy enough to call for all
the capital by any means available.</p>

<p>Egholm sniffed vigorously, and postponed the
matter further. But now it was February, and he
must raise the question somehow. He smoothed
his hair with extra attention, to make the most of his
dignity when the pupil arrived. Unfortunately, he
could hardly point to the goods delivered and demand
payment in cash&mdash;the goods were so little in
evidence.</p>

<p>It passed off better than he had expected. Meilby
said “Good evening” in English when he arrived,
and laughed a little nervously, as if dismayed at his
own courage. Egholm snatched at the opening, and
came to the point at once:</p>

<p>“That’s right, that’s right&mdash;you’re getting on.
Getting on, yes. But don’t you think, now, you
might let me have a little on account?”</p>

<p>Meilby laughed no more. Money&mdash;it was always
such a nuisance about money. There didn’t seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to be any money these days. Money was a thing
extinct, he said.</p>

<p>“On earth, yes,” Egholm admitted.</p>

<p>But no need to bother about that. It would be
all right. Only wait to the end of the month, and
then it would be decided. “Whether I’m to go or
not,” said Meilby.</p>

<p>Of course, he didn’t want to go. Much rather
stay where he was. But, of course, he would go all
the same. What else could he do? And if he went,
why, then, of course, Egholm would get his money.
That was how it stood. How else could it be?</p>

<p>Egholm was very far from understanding, but he
gave it up. Opening the book, he got to work at
the lesson, but with less careful attention, perhaps,
than usual. And after a little he broke in, cutting
short his pupil in the middle of a sentence:</p>

<p>“But about the money&mdash;how will you get the
money if you do go?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, of course, I shall sell all my
apparatus.”</p>

<p>So that was it. Egholm still seemed troubled in
his mind. He knew the collection of things that
formed Meilby’s stock-in-trade. There was one
item in particular&mdash;that devilish camera of his. It
was quite a small one, but with a breadth of focus
that could almost look round a corner. Fancy having
that for his own! There would be an end of poverty
then!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The windows of heaven should be opened, and the
flood pour in&mdash;oh, in no time. He knew it, he felt
sure of it. But the belly was not to be put off, not for
so much as a day. And his hands were impatient too;
there was a nervous thrill at the roots of the nails,
or a deadly chill in the fingers from sheer inactivity.
Every morning he raced about after the situations
vacant in the papers, but always in vain. With
Meilby’s apparatus, he could make money&mdash;ay,
though his studio had no roof but the February sky.</p>

<p>He grew quite genial towards his pupil, and
praised him more than was properly his due. When
they had finished with their brainwork for the
evening, he said anxiously:</p>

<p>“But, promise me you don’t go selling them without
letting me know.”</p>

<p>Meilby would bear it in mind.</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose you forgot?”</p>

<p>“Why, we’ll be none the less friends for that,”
said Meilby, with an amiable smile.</p>

<p>“You’ll get nothing out of him, you see,” said
Anna when he had gone. “It’ll be just the same
with him as with young Karlsen, when he came to
learn English, too. Huh! It was you that learned
something that time, if you ask me.”</p>

<p>“He’s an artful one,” said Egholm, with a laugh.
“He tricked the doctor when he went to be examined.
But, after all&mdash;what’s a trifle like that when a man
stands firm on the rock of truth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think Meilby does? You think it’s for
any good he’s going running off to America like that?”</p>

<p>Egholm, law-abiding man, paled at the thought,
but said, with an attempt at liveliness:</p>

<p>“I’ll get him to stay, then.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t pay you at all unless he goes.”</p>

<p>That, again, was true&mdash;painfully true. No ...
anyhow, Egholm would have nothing to do with any
doubtful affairs. Not for any price. Better let
Meilby go his own gait as soon as he pleased.</p>

<p>But even as he formed the thought, he seemed
to feel the milled edges of the screws that set the
camera between his fingers, and with a sigh he
breathed the resolution from him once more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One morning, a few days later, Egholm came back
from his usual round.</p>

<p>“No luck, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” he snarled, flinging off his hat.
Then he took down the Bible.</p>

<p>What could have happened to make his hands
shake like that?</p>

<p>A few minutes later came the explanation.</p>

<p>“I went after a job&mdash;Hansen and Tvede, it was&mdash;as
errand boy. Told them they could have me a
full day’s work just for my food. But they laughed
at me. Oh, and there was a beast of a fellow in
riding-boots&mdash;the manager, perhaps. You should
have seen his face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps he meant it wasn’t the sort of thing
they could offer you. Something better,” hinted
Fru Egholm.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but strove to calm his indignation
by strenuous attention to the Bible. If
that didn’t help him, why, then.... But he was
nearly through with it now&mdash;it was the Epistle to
the Hebrews.</p>

<p>The letters danced and crept like ants before his
eyes.</p>

<p>“<em>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who
receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment
to take tithes of the people according to the law,
that is, of their brethren....</em>”</p>

<p>“Ha ha! Riding-boots and all! No, ’twasn’t
that he meant, giving me something better. The
beast! I shan’t forget him!”</p>

<p>“<em>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of
necessity a change also of the law....</em>”</p>

<p>“‘I see from the paper you’re wanting an errand
boy’&mdash;that’s what I said to him. And asked if I
would do. And I crushed my hat in my hands and
stood up. Then, of course, what he ought to have
said was, ‘What, <em>you</em> looking for a place as errand
boy? No, no. Couldn’t think of it. I’ll take you
on in the office, as a clerk. You shall be cashier.
I’ve taken a fancy to you, the way you stand
there modestly as could be.’ But he didn’t say
that, not a word of it. Good Lord, no! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
worst of it was, he saw through me. <em>He winked
at me!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment
going before for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof.</em></p>

<p>“<em>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing
in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh
unto God.</em>”</p>

<p>Egholm sighed, and passed his hand over his
face. Alas, he noted to his shame how his thoughts
had strayed from the Bible’s lofty theme.</p>

<p>What could it be for a commandment, that was
disannulled for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof, he wondered. H’m, it would say farther
on, no doubt. And he read on, but it did not appear
to say. Then he went back and began again, reading
slowly, in a whisper, the same verses over again.
And of a sudden, his heart contracted violently,
forcing a spout of blood to his temples. What&mdash;what
was this? Was it <em>the tithe</em> that was abolished?</p>

<p>He read it through again and again.</p>

<p>“Anna”&mdash;he dared not trust his own senses
now&mdash;“Anna, come here and look at this. Quick&mdash;read
from there to there.” He stood as if about
to strike; there were red spots on his pale face.
Anna trembled with fear, and fell to reading about
Melchisedec, the Levites, and the rest, without
understanding a word of it all.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you speak, woman?” broke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Egholm, when she had been reading a few seconds.
“Are you asleep?&mdash;or, perhaps it doesn’t interest
you? Eh? Now, then, what is it you’re reading?&mdash;what
do you make of it? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see,” stammered Fru Egholm, her
eyes flitting to another part altogether in her confusion&mdash;“something
about the Tabernacle....”</p>

<p>“Is the tithe abolished?&mdash;that’s what I want
to know,” said Egholm insistently. “Does it say
there, or does it not, that the tithe is weak and
unprofitable?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;but that’s what I’ve always said,”
answered she, with marvellous presence of mind.
“Was it only that you wanted me to see?”</p>

<p>Egholm looked her up and down contemptuously.</p>

<p>A moment later he was tearing down the street
with the big family Bible all uncovered under one
arm.</p>

<p>Oh, but this was the most wonderful day of his
life! The Bible itself had revealed its darkest
secrets to him&mdash;<em>to him alone</em>. What would they say,
all those whose minds were yet in darkness? what
would old Angel Karlsen say? what would young
Evangelist Karlsen look like with his wrinkled face&mdash;when
they heard that the Community of the Brethren
of St. John was built on sand&mdash;nay, upon a swamp,
into the bottomless depth of which their money
sank never to be seen again? <em>He, Egholm, was a new
Luther</em>, wielding the Bible as a mighty club against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
heresy and false doctrine. They would have to make
him Angel, ay, Archangel, after this. In every
land where the Brethren of St. John were known,
his name would be named with honour. He would
write a new Book of Laws for the Brotherhood, and
it should be translated into seven tongues. Into
seven tongues! Almost like a new Bible.</p>

<p>Karlsen’s shop was at a corner of the market
square. It was a very old house, with a steep red
roof. At the bottom two small windows had been
let in to make it look like a shop, and through them
one could discern, in spite of a thick layer of cobwebs
and dust, the rows of shelves with yellow jars in all
sizes. The modest store was suited to the taste of
the peasant customers. They could stand for ages
pondering over the choice of a shovel or rake, and
weighing it in the hand. Karlsen was understood
to be a wealthy man.</p>

<p>Egholm inquired of a chilblainy youth if he could
speak with Angel Karlsen.</p>

<p>H’m. He didn’t know. Would go in and ask.</p>

<p>“Say it’s something of importance,” said Egholm.</p>

<p>As the door in the corner was opened, Egholm
heard a sound of voices in dispute from the office
beyond. Two voices&mdash;and he could not recognise
either. Or was it&mdash;yes, surely that was old Karlsen’s,
after all? Egholm listened in wonder, as one might
listen to a familiar air played out of time or at a
different pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Call me a scoundrel if you like,” shouted the
one, a nasal trumpeting voice with a twang of city
jargon&mdash;“call me a thief, a convict, or anything
you damn well please, but I won’t be called a fool!”</p>

<p>“But the contract, the contract, the contract!”
screamed out the angelic voice of Karlsen the Elder.</p>

<p>No, the young man was sorry, Hr. Karlsen
could not possibly see him just now. He was
engaged with one of the travellers.</p>

<p>“Well, I must see him, anyhow,” said Egholm
more soberly.</p>

<p>They were at it again inside, and his knock was
unheeded. Then suddenly the whole seemed to
collapse in a cascade of laughter.</p>

<p>He knocked again, and walked in. There was
old Karlsen, his face unevenly flushed, with a fat
cigar sticking out of his beard, and before him a
bright-eyed, elegantly dressed commercial traveller,
who slapped the Angel’s outstretched hand repeatedly,
both men laughing at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Hr. Karlsen&mdash;er&mdash;would you kindly
read this?...” Where was it now? Egholm
began helplessly turning the pages of his Bible.</p>

<p>“Hullo, here’s somebody wants to save our souls,
by the look of it,” said the elegant one, with a tentative
laugh.</p>

<p>“Didn’t my young man out there tell you I was
engaged?” said old Karlsen angrily, turning aside.</p>

<p>“But it’s a discovery I’ve made&mdash;it’s of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
utmost importance. A wonderful find&mdash;here in the
Holy Scripture itself. Read it, here&mdash;it’s only a few
lines. I can hardly believe my own senses. Read it&mdash;there!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear friend,” said the Angel, “you can
see for yourself I’m engaged. We’re in the middle
of important business.”</p>

<p>“Let me read just three words to you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no, I won’t have it, I say.”</p>

<p>Egholm stood with hectic cheeks; his former
respect for the Angel still checked any actual outburst
of fury, but from the look of him, it was
doubtful what might happen next.</p>

<p>“This is not the proper place to discuss the word
of God, nor the proper time, nor the mood for it,
either. Come round again this evening, my dear
Egholm. At eight, say, and then we can talk over
whatever it is that’s troubling you.”</p>

<p>The commercial plucked him by the sleeve.
“I thought you were coming round to the hotel&mdash;<i>Postgaarden</i>,
you said.”</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;well, we might say <em>to-morrow</em> evening at
eight,” corrected the Angel. “Yes, come round
to-morrow, Egholm; that will do.”</p>

<p>Egholm drew himself up and shot sparks, but
said nothing. He shut up the clasp of his Bible
with a snap.</p>

<p>“Have a cigar, won’t you?” said the Angel,
offering the box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, do. They’re none so bad&mdash;what,
Hr. Nathan?”</p>

<p>Hr. Nathan uttered a curious sound&mdash;an articulate
shudder, as it were&mdash;and looked quizzically at
the box.</p>

<p>“I don’t smoke.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, a glass of port?”</p>

<p>“I’ve other things to think about than drinking
wine. The fate of the Brotherhood lies in
my hand. In <em>my</em> hand. I’m going round to the
Deacon now.”</p>

<p>“No, really? He he! Are you really? Well,
well,” said Karlsen, with that strangely jovial angel
voice of his, that Egholm knew so well, and yet found
strange....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV</h2>


<p class="firstpara">But Egholm was so shaken by his interview with
the Angel that he did not go round to the
Deacon after all. The Deacon was a pottery
worker, living at a village just outside the town.</p>

<p>He went back home to look again and make sure
it was right. He clutched the Bible tightly under
his arm as he walked, as if in dread lest the all-important
text might drop out.</p>

<p>Yes, there it was. He read through the passage
again in wonder, and fell to musing anew.</p>

<p>That same evening Evangelist Karlsen came
round.</p>

<p>Egholm shook his head nervously.</p>

<p>“It’s no good, Karlsen. No. I’m not going to
give in.”</p>

<p>Young Karlsen stood staring open mouthed.</p>

<p>“No. I’ve settled up with myself once and for
all. I won’t give in. I know well enough what
you’ve come for.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear friends, what on earth are you
talking about? Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Karlsen, you know as well as I do it’s your father
sent you round,” said Egholm almost pleadingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“I swear I know nothing of the sort. I’ve only
just got back this evening. From Veile. Know
Justesen, the horsedealer, there? Been seeing him.
And then on the way&mdash;I’ve been dragging my bag
along, and it’s heavy. I thought I’d just look in
for a breather.”</p>

<p>“Let Sivert carry it for you,” said Fru Egholm.</p>

<p>“No, thanks, it’s all right outside on the stairs.
I never like to leave it very long.”</p>

<p>Egholm put his hand to his eyes; the cracked
and furrowed countenance of the Evangelist always
distracted his attention. Then he began telling of
his discovery&mdash;first, in mysterious roundabout hints,
then suddenly breaking out into fiery declamation,
with the open book before him, and his finger-nail
underlining the words.</p>

<p>Karlsen was thunderstruck. And he thought <em>he</em>
knew his Bible.... Never in his life had he come
across that place. He stamped about the room,
spitting into all four corners.</p>

<p>Egholm went further; he drew up an outline
of the new laws, the entire reorganisation....</p>

<p>“It’ll be a hard struggle for me, I know. But
I’ll....”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll manage it all right,” said Karlsen
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Eh? D’you mean to say ... you’re on my
side?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m on the side of the Bible, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>And there was Egholm with the enemy’s leading
general won over, without a blow!</p>

<p>“It’s the only thing to do, anyway,” explained
Karlsen, “as things are now. There’s been some
talk about you having my place when I moved
up. But I don’t know what they’ll say to that
now....”</p>

<p>“Me! Evangelist!” Egholm turned stiff all
over.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Karlsen quietly.</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard a word about it before.”</p>

<p>“Well, the Elders have gathered together....
But it was to be a surprise, you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” murmured Egholm faintly. Again
it overwhelmed him for the moment, but he recovered
himself, and said, with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Who knows, they might make me Angel now.”</p>

<p>“Almost sure to, I should say,” opined the dark
Evangelist.</p>

<p>Egholm felt calm and strong now, no longer
dizzy as he had been during the morning. And
Karlsen was really a jolly sort, after all. Here he
was, actually gloating over the face his respected
father, the Angel, would set up when the bombshell
burst.</p>

<p>The upshot of it was that they worked out a
plan together.</p>

<p>Egholm was to prepare a grand speech for the
meeting next Wednesday. Karlsen knew&mdash;now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
came to think of it&mdash;quite a lot of first-rate texts
that could be used, in support of the new discovery.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think”&mdash;Egholm lowered his
voice confidentially&mdash;“wouldn’t it be better if I
went round to the Brethren, and just let them know
how it stands?”</p>

<p>Karlsen pondered.</p>

<p>“H’m. I should say, the best way’s to take the
whole congregation by surprise, all at once. Better
effect, you know, when you can stand there and throw
out a hand and there it is! And you’ve quite a
decent platform manner, to my mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Egholm, beaming.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’ll trot round and tackle a few of
the thickest heads myself. I’ve a certain amount of
influence, you know, and authority, and all that.
I know how to manage them.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, it’s as good as done!” Egholm’s
voice was almost a song.</p>

<p>“Easy as winking,” said Karlsen confidently.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how glad I am you came over
to the right side at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind about that. You can always
do me a little service some time in return.”</p>

<p>They stayed up till nearly midnight. Egholm
strode up and down, filling the room with words.
Possibly he was already rehearsing for the coming
Wednesday. Karlsen smoked, and drank many cups
of black coffee. The children hung over the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
limp and heavy with drowsiness, casting greedy
glances at the settee. Their mother tore at her
sewing more violently than usual, and sighed aloud.</p>

<p>At last Karlsen took his leave. Egholm could
not bear to break off even then, but went out with
him. He waved his arms in the air, and tripped
about, now and then actually circling round his
companion as they walked.</p>

<p>Did he think, now, the Bible Society would
care to have a dissertation on the two conflicting
points? There ought, at any rate, to be some kind
of indication, an asterisk, say, in the first place, to
save others from confusion.</p>

<p>Karlsen thought they very likely would.</p>

<p>The street lamps glowed red in the fog. A
policeman appeared at a corner, waved to them
cheerfully, and said sympathetically: “Get along
home; that’s the best place for you.”</p>

<p>“Thinks we’re drunk,” said Egholm, and stopped
for breath. “But&mdash;we’ve been talking, and never
thought ... your bag. We’ve forgotten all about
it.”</p>

<p>“Bag? Oh yes.... No; that’s all right. I
spotted the old man’s cart just outside the station,
and sent it home by that.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then that’s all right.” Egholm’s
thoughts were at once occupied with something else.
His brain was fluttering with innumerable winged
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, better say good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, Karlsen. And thanks, thanks.
You shall be Angel, if I can put in a word.”</p>

<p>Egholm looked round, confused. Where had
they got to now? These big houses ... it wasn’t
the way....</p>

<p>“I’ll see you right home,” he offered.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;I’m not exactly going home just
yet,” said the Evangelist, with some embarrassment.
“Just a hand at cards with a few friends, that’s
all.” He sighed guiltily. “But if I do win a <i>kroner</i>,
say, it means ten <i>øre</i> to the Brethren.... Oh, I
forgot, that’s all over now, of course.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;d’you mean to say there’s anybody up at
this time of night?” asked Egholm in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Only a couple of friends&mdash;Brethren in the
Lord.”</p>

<p>“But where?”</p>

<p>“In the red room at the Hotel <i>Postgaarden</i>,”
said Karlsen innocently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2>V</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Going round to the meeting on the following
Wednesday, Egholm was surprised to find
the hall already full, though it was not yet
eight o’clock. He was also surprised, and agreeably
so, to perceive that his entry created some stir.
Evidently, Karlsen had let fall a word of what was
to happen. Unless, indeed, it were the Lord Himself
that had given hint of it to each individually. Anyhow,
it was just as well to have plenty of witnesses
in a case like this.</p>

<p>But where&mdash;where were the Elders of the flock?</p>

<p>Egholm sat down at the back of the hall, by the
stove; it was a pious impulse that had come to him,
having in mind the promise that whoso humbleth
himself shall be exalted. And it was a good idea in
other ways, he thought. The little group of paupers
would form an excellent background.</p>

<p>“Angel Karlsen&mdash;hasn’t he come yet?” he
whispered to a shawl-wrapped crone at his side.</p>

<p>The woman looked round, showing a face weather-worn
and overgrown like a relic of the past. A single
tooth showed like a stone wedge in her half-open
mouth. She made no answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm repeated his question, with no more
result than before. Oh, but, of course, it was Deaf
Maren. He had forgotten for the moment. But
how ugly she looked to-night&mdash;and what a malicious
glance she gave him. And the others, too, all with
the same forbidding look&mdash;why couldn’t they answer?
It was plain to see they had heard his question, and
that they knew enough to tell him if they would.
But every one of them turned away, or looked down
at the floor&mdash;until at last Madam Strand, the gipsy
woman, who was sitting on a bench at the extreme
left, crept up to him with a submissive curtsey.</p>

<p>“They’re in there&mdash;all of them,” she said, with
a shake of her thin grey locks. “All the God-fearing
lot&mdash;the Angel, and the Prophet from Copenhagen&mdash;bless
’em&mdash;and the Deacon and young Karlsen.
Talking and talking and making their plans. Such
a fuss they’re making to-night&mdash;enough to make a
body quake all over.”</p>

<p>She passed her wrinkled skinny hand over his
wrist as she spoke.</p>

<p>Egholm felt his heart beat faster. He glanced
over towards the door Madam Strand had indicated;
it led to a little anteroom that was used, among other
things, as a dressing-room for the gymnasium class.
He fancied he could hear voices. A moment ago
he had felt something like pity for all these people,
whose conviction he would now be called upon to
shatter and replace by another. But already he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
found himself in need of courage, seeking comfort
from the fact that, after all, the weapon was in his
hand. What did it matter if there were many who
came up against him? And young Karlsen, no
doubt, would help to bear the brunt of it.</p>

<p>This last was merely a sort of aside to himself.
But Egholm felt his doubts of the Evangelist’s
honesty suddenly grown stronger than ever.</p>

<p>Those artful round eyes of his&mdash;and the queer
look in them when he had said good-night that
evening outside Hotel <i>Postgaarden</i>. What could one
expect from a man who went off to play cards at
twelve o’clock at night at hotels? And what sort
of companions could he find for the same? “Brethren
in the Lord,” indeed! It was an expensive place,
too, that one could hardly expect the poorer Brethren
to frequent. Wait a bit, though: <i>Postgaarden</i> ...
wasn’t it there the commercial traveller man was
going to meet old Karlsen that same evening?...
To sum up, then, nothing more nor less than a neat
piece of spying, and carrying the whole tale to his
father immediately after! After which, of course,
he had simply been sent round to all these simple
souls, to set their minds against him, Egholm....</p>

<p>It would be a hard fight now.</p>

<p>Fru Westergaard and Mirre, the dog, passed by.
Egholm rose and bowed, but received only a half-glance
in return. Fru Westergaard made her way
through to her privileged chair, and sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
carefully, arranging her skirts about the dog’s
head.</p>

<p>Her arrival was like that of the bride at a wedding,
the signal for proceedings to begin. At the same
moment, the door of the little room opened, and a
little troop of men&mdash;looking, to tell the truth, more
like mutes at a funeral than anything to do with
weddings&mdash;marched in close order up on to the stage.
At their head the Angel, wrapped in his beard, which
seemed alive with electric tension. After him
marched the Prophet from Copenhagen&mdash;a quondam
priest by the name of Finck&mdash;together with
the Deacon, Potter Kaasmose, whose long hair was
plastered down and cut as if to the rim of one of his
own pots. Of the remaining five, Egholm knew only
two&mdash;Dideriksen, the Apostle, and Karlsen, the
Evangelist. Dideriksen was a very pious man, as was
apparent, for instance, in his habit of constantly
stroking downwards over his face. Karlsen had put
on a glaring red tie, which gave him a martial touch.
He looked as if he were gloating over some great
disaster. The stairs had been widened with a
further consignment of beer boxes, so that the procession
could mount the platform in something like
order.</p>

<p>A breathless silence reigned among the congregation
when Angel Karlsen began to pray, while the
remaining Elders seated themselves in a half-circle.
The Copenhagen Prophet, evidently on easy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
familiar terms with platforms, thrust his coat-tails
carelessly aside, polished his gold pince-nez with a
handkerchief of brilliant whiteness, and did other
things hitherto unknown in those surroundings.
Young Karlsen, for instance&mdash;not to speak of Potter
Kaasmose&mdash;would have been utterly unable to imitate
the elegant movement with which he flung one leg
over the other, after first pulling up the legs of his
trousers. He had chosen his seat on the extreme
right, like the first violin in an orchestra. His
interesting appearance could hardly fail to draw off
some attention from the prayer, but was no doubt
edifying in itself.</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Angel Karlsen.</p>

<p>“And having now concluded this prayer which
Thou Thyself hast taught us, we further pray that
this our ancient congregation, founded by St. John
the Apostle, and lasting even unto this day in despite
of the deluge of sin and the drought of indifference,
may likewise henceforward so prevail against the
ravages of the wolf that steals abroad by night, that
neither sheep nor lamb may fall a prey.</p>

<p>“All ye who were present here last evening know
what I mean. But for those others who do not, I
will briefly set forth the matter which has called us
Elders to gather in conclave here to-night.”</p>

<p>Egholm sat gasping as if half stunned. “Present
here <em>last evening</em>!...” Then they had called
a meeting, without his knowledge&mdash;a meeting where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
they had betrayed him and his great cause, and
sowed the seed of hatred against him in all the
hearts of those who had no judgment of their own.
In the midst of his anger, indignation, and fear,
Egholm yet tried to frame a prayer for strength and
courage. But he could do no more than mumble
helplessly: “I’m in the right, you know I am.
Lord God, you know I’m in the right.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, old Karlsen was reciting a pretty
parable about the wolf that took upon itself sheep’s
clothing, that it might deceive the unwary&mdash;ay, even
the shepherd himself, that he might open the door
of the fold and let that monster enter in, with kindly
words: “Enter, poor strayed sheep, and be refreshed
with the grass of this pleasant fold.” But then one
day the shepherd looked into the eyes of that wolf
in sheep’s clothing, and lo! they were eyes of fire.
And another day he looked at its teeth, and lo!
they were the teeth of a wolf. But the monster
believed itself still safe and unsuspected&mdash;even until
to-night. “And so it comes here amongst us at this
moment, and says to the sheep: ‘Follow me. I
know a place where the grass is richer and more
pleasant; make haste and leave that evil shepherd,
who shears you of your fleece. I will lead you; I
will be your shepherd!’”</p>

<p>When the Angel had finished, Egholm rose, pale
and ill at ease, and begged leave to speak. But his
seat was so far back, and his voice so weak, that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on the platform might be excused for overlooking
him. All heard, however, when young Karlsen
called out the number of a hymn, and though Egholm
repeated his request in a slightly louder voice, the
congregation began singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Up, ye Christians, up and doing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors of the Lord, to arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, the foeman’s host pursuing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the power of war’s alarms.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Draw and smite<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell is arming ’gainst the Light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Follow in your leader’s train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trusting in his strength to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Satan hopes the day to gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up, and smite the host of sin!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Here at hand<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Still doth stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who can all powers command!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Egholm had lost patience. As the hymn concluded,
he sprang up and roared across the hall:</p>

<p>“Look here, do you mean to say <em>I’m</em> Satan?”</p>

<p>There was a stir as all in the hall turned round.
Fru Westergaard’s chair rocked suddenly, and a bench
crashed down, but after that followed a moment of
icy silence, cleft immediately by Karlsen’s angel
trumpet:</p>

<p>“Guilty conscience, Egholm?”</p>

<p>A new silence, Egholm stammering and gurgling,
but finding no appropriate answer. Then the
Evangelist let loose a shower of insulting laughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Strangely enough, this had the effect of bringing
Egholm to his senses.</p>

<p>“I was the first to ask; it’s your place to answer.
D’you mean to say I’m Satan?”</p>

<p>And before any of the Elders on the platform
could pull themselves sufficiently together, he went
on:</p>

<p>“Do you know this book here? It’s an old one,
and the title-page is missing. You think, perhaps,
it’s St. Cyprian, but I can tell you, it’s the Holy
Scripture. Yes, that’s what it is. And what I have
to say to you now is just the words of the Scriptures,
and no more. Holy Scripture, pure and undefiled.
I’ll read it out, and you can judge for yourselves.
I tell you, you haven’t got a shepherd at all; you’ve
a <em>butcher</em>!”</p>

<p>At the first exchange of words, the congregation
had been confused and uneasy, quivering this way
and that like a magnetic needle exposed to intermittent
current. Now, Egholm had, it is true, most
of them facing his way, but many looked up to the
Elders, and especially to the Angel, partly to see the
effect of Egholm’s words, and partly to gain some
hint as to which way their own feeling should tend.
The congregation was thus divided, but Egholm
wanted it united. Accordingly, he left his place
between Deaf Maren and the stove, and advanced
by jerks, still speaking, up towards his foes.</p>

<p>Yes, he knew it was a serious thing to call Angel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Karlsen&mdash;Egholm shook a little at the venerable
words&mdash;a butcher. But it was plain to him now,
after what had passed, that Angel Karlsen was not
acting in good faith as regards the point in dispute:
whether tithe should be paid, or if tithe had been
abolished by God’s own word, and was consequently
foolish&mdash;nay, wicked. But if the Angel knew God’s
will, and did not act upon it, and open the eyes of
the Brotherhood to the same, then no words could
be too strong.</p>

<p>Egholm spoke for twenty minutes. He had got
right to the front, and stepped up on to the first
of the beer boxes, making, as it were, an act drop of
his body in front of those on the platform. The
audience could only see their shadows, and hear a
slight sound when the Copenhagen Prophet cleared
his throat. Once young Karlsen tried his devilish
laugh, but was sternly suppressed by his venerable
sire. There was no real disturbance of any sort;
the congregation made but one listening, eager
face. The Elders were exorcised already. Victory&mdash;victory!</p>

<p>But at the very moment when the thought first
thrilled him, Egholm’s eloquence suddenly ran dry.
With a spasm of dread he realised that he could
say no more. The source within him, that he had
imagined endless, had ceased. He had not firmness
enough to begin again, and the texts and parables
he had chosen for his purpose had been rehearsed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
often in his mind for the occasion that he could not
now remember what he had actually said and what
he could still use.</p>

<p>The emptiness that followed was almost physically
oppressive&mdash;Egholm gasped once or twice as if
the very air about him were gone. Then came the
voice of the Angel, calm and firm:</p>

<p>“Have you any more to say?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Egholm, paling as he spoke. “I
hope now you have understood.”</p>

<p>And with that he stepped down from his elevation,
sighed, wiped his forehead nervously, and leaned
up against the wall at the side.</p>

<p>Old Karlsen delivered a prayer longer and more
powerful than ever before. It gathered like a cloud
above the congregation, gradually obscuring all that
Egholm had said. Not until he noticed that the
cloud had condensed here and there to a mild rain
of tears did the Angel pass over imperceptibly to
mention of Egholm’s onslaught.</p>

<p>“And now, now&mdash;well, you have heard the
leader of your flock, the shepherd and Angel of the
Brotherhood, referred to as a butcher. Here, in our
own house, and out of the mouth of one whom we
regarded as a brother. Why do I not lift up my
hand against him, and drive him forth, even as the
Master drove out those from the Temple who defiled
its holy places? No! For it is written: <em>Blessed
are the meek</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The Angel’s prayer had opened the hearts of the
flock. Thereupon Finck the Prophet stepped forward.
He wore a reddish-brown beard, his eyebrows
were bushy, and his eyes glittered behind his
glasses. It seemed as if he had hitherto affected
lordly indifference, but was now so moved that he
could no longer control his emotion, and his anger
burst forth in a torrent.</p>

<p>“In days gone by,” he began, “when I realised
that the Established Church of Denmark was being
suffered to drift like a ship without a compass, I
declined to stay on board. And before leaving, I
warned my fellow-travellers, and the captain and the
mate. I told them in plain, bold words that they
were drifting towards shipwreck. Many believed
that my words were over-bold. A conflict raged
about my name, as some of you may perhaps
remember. But, now, we have heard a man whose
words were not bold, but only brutal and coarse&mdash;a
man who, I think I am qualified to say, lacks the
very rudiments of ability to understand what he
reads. This ignoramus takes upon himself to pick
out a verse here and a verse there, and then adds
them together in a fashion of his own. We may
compare him with the man who read one day in his
Bible: ‘Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and
slew him’&mdash;and the next: ‘Go thou and do likewise.’...”</p>

<p>The sum and essence of Finck’s oration was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the rendering of tithe was a jewel of price reserved
for the Brotherhood of St. John apart from all others.
To cast away that jewel now would be sheer madness.</p>

<p>Egholm stood quivering with impatience to
answer. His mind was clear now as to what he
should say. And as soon as Finck had ended, he
sprang forward.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that Hr. Finck, the Prophet,
in spite of all his claims to learning, and his libellous
attack....”</p>

<p>“Silence, man!” roared Finck, his voice echoing
roundly from the walls. “We will hear no more.
You have said your last word here. Go!”</p>

<p>“My turn now,” said young Karlsen, with a
swaggering fling of his shoulders.</p>

<p>But the venerable Angel could not find it in his
heart to deny Egholm a last word. He found it
preferable to let him wreak his own destruction.
And with his keen perception of the feeling among
the congregation, he was confident that this would
be the result.</p>

<p>“Beloved Brethren,” he said, “there is but a
quarter of an hour left us&mdash;one poor quarter of an
hour. I had endeavoured to secure the hall for another
hour, but other and more worldly matters
intervened. I think, then, we should let Egholm
say what his conscience permits him, and then conclude
with the old hymn: ‘All is in the Father’s
hand.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should just like to ask Prophet Finck,” said
Egholm furiously, “how <em>he</em> would interpret and
explain....”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said Finck loftily.</p>

<p>“The leading point, the essence of the whole
thing, namely, the text found by me in the Epistle
to the Hebrews&mdash;you have not said a word about
that, really. I am firmly convinced that I am right,
but, all the same, I should like to hear how you
propose to explain away....”</p>

<p>“Write it down,” broke in Finck sharply.</p>

<p>Egholm obeyed involuntarily. He found a stump
of lead pencil in his waistcoat pocket, and began
scrawling on the faded paper at the back of his Bible.
He was a facile writer ordinarily, but in his present
state of emotion he could hardly frame his question.
Two or three times he struck out what he had written
and began again. Suddenly he heard young Karlsen
clearing his throat, and then:</p>

<p>“Now, then, we’d better....”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Egholm.</p>

<p>“Throw that man out,” commanded Finck.</p>

<p>“You cowards, you’re afraid to let me
speak!”</p>

<p>“Oh, go and heave him out, Johannes,” called
young Karlsen, leaning over the footlights.</p>

<p>But Johannes, the postman, was paralysed already
by the unwonted tumult, and did not move. There
were others in the hall, however, who seemed eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
enough to respond to the invitation, seeing that
Karlsen himself was to be responsible.</p>

<p>“You miserable traitor,” hissed Egholm, “give
me back my tithes, give me my money, and I’ll
go. But not before. Give me my four hundred
<i>kroner</i>.”</p>

<p>“Turn him out, the wretch!”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘All is in the Father’s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things answer His command....’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="firstpara">The Angel made a brave attempt to start the hymn,
but the congregation appeared more interested in
the conflict, and no one followed his lead.</p>

<p>“My money&mdash;give me my money, you thieves!”</p>

<p>“Pot calling the kettle black!” cried the Evangelist,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Liar, slanderer, scoundrel!” roared Egholm,
seeing in this last remark a reference to the manner
of his dismissal from the railway service. And,
beside himself with fury, he raised the heavy Bible
to throw at Karlsen, when a diversion took place
which drew off his attention and that of the
audience.</p>

<p>A confused but violent noise came from the back
of the hall, and then repeated shouts that rose above
the din.</p>

<p>“You lanky black beast! You filthy devil!
What about the seventh commandment? Yes; it’s
you I mean, you filthy, incontinent swine! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
evangelical hypocrite! What about Metha, eh?
She’s lying there at home now and asking for you&mdash;for
you!”</p>

<p>The words were plain and to the point; everyone
in the hall stared in amazement at the backsliding
photographer, who was standing on a bench
and waving clenched fists in the air. It was evident
that he had been drinking.</p>

<p>Then they turned to look at young Karlsen. His
face was drawn awry.</p>

<p>Egholm was so moved at this unexpected reinforcement
that the tears flowed down his cheeks.
He found voice again and took up the cry.</p>

<p>“They’re a lot of criminals, all of them. Setting
themselves up against God’s laws that I’ve discovered.
I’ll have you up, that I will. Give me
my money, my money!”</p>

<p>Young Karlsen lost his self-control. He sprang
in long leaps down through the hall, and flung
himself upon Egholm, thrusting his head forward like
a bull about to charge.</p>

<p>“You shut yo’ jaw!” he cried, lapsing into his
country dialect.</p>

<p>“Lauritz, be careful!” cried the Angel warningly.
But it was too late. Finck came up to take part,
and Egholm was borne towards the door, still shouting,
and hanging on with arms and legs to the benches
as he passed.</p>

<p>A little party of Brethren carried Meilby in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
similar fashion to the door. Serve him right, the
sneak, always behindhand with his tithes....</p>

<p>The hall was filled with shouts and oaths, cries,
and the barking of a dog.</p>

<p>The Histrionics gathered open mouthed about
the doorway. It was their dress-rehearsal night for
the coming performance of <cite>The Lovers’ Secret</cite>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Meilby was in difficulties with his dress&mdash;his
braces had given way&mdash;and Egholm was
sucking an abrasion on the back of his
hand. Nevertheless, each felt a sense of relief, as
they walked briskly over the cobblestones, talking
loudly and emphatically.</p>

<p>“If the Lord had sent a rain of fire upon their
heads ... I was looking for it all the time. I
can’t understand that He didn’t. Can you, now?”</p>

<p>Meilby answered, with a self-satisfied smile:</p>

<p>“Wasn’t wanted, that’s about it. He sent me
instead.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s true. Thanks, Meilby&mdash;thanks for
your help,” said Egholm, pressing the other’s arm.
“But what was it all about, really? I was so excited
at the time.... I mean, what was behind it all?”</p>

<p>“Ha ha, yes, what was behind it all! Metha
Madsen was behind it all&mdash;Metha and her brat.
Karlsen’s it was, and they’ve been trying to make
out it was mine.”</p>

<p>“Terrible, terrible!”</p>

<p>“No; it’s not. I’m going away, and I’ll be out
of it all. The old Angel in his little shop, he fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it all up, for her to say it was me. Wouldn’t have
done for his dear little son, you know, and an
Evangelist into the bargain. Kid was born at ten
o’clock, and it wasn’t stillborn either.”</p>

<p>“But you could declare on oath....”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, that’s a ticklish business. On
oath.... No; I did the only thing there was to be
done&mdash;came along every evening to the meetings,
and glared at them, and threatened to kick up a
scandal. But it’s not so easy to make a speech in a
crowd like that. Anyhow, I managed it all right
this time, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Splendidly. And now&mdash;you’re going away?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow. First thing to-morrow morning,”
whispered Meilby hoarsely. “Come up with me
now. I shan’t go to bed to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s all empty!” said Egholm dismally,
looking round the place. There was a travelling
trunk in the middle of the studio floor, and that
was all.</p>

<p>“Every rag and stick cleared out,” said Meilby
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“But you promised me&mdash;you promised me for
certain....”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve fixed it up for you all right. Never
meant to do you in, you know. That I swear. Not
from the first evening. Here&mdash;here’s the pawnticket
for some neat little things&mdash;that’s yours. I’ve sold
the rest. Eh? Oh, don’t mention it, not at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm read the legend on the ticket&mdash;for a
matter of a few <i>kroner</i> he could buy the camera thing
outright. He was delighted; he was touched.</p>

<p>“None of your sneaking Angel ways about me,”
said Meilby simply.</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do over there when
you get there?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? Don’t even know where
America is. If I hadn’t got my ticket, I’d never find
the way. But I’ve got it all right, thank the Lord!
Here, you can see. Looks like business, doesn’t it,
what? But it’s a long way, that’s true. Wonder if
there’s women there....”</p>

<p>Egholm staggered off homewards.</p>

<p>If only he could go with Meilby. Get away out
of this hole, with its hypocrites and scoundrels, its
patent-shoed prophets and broadcloth deacons, away
to America....</p>

<p>Yes; Egholm felt he must go. Not to America,
of course&mdash;that was beyond him. But go somewhere.
Just a few miles away. Knarreby, for instance, or
somewhere thereabout. Meilby’s camera would keep
him above water, wherever he chose to commit himself
to the waves&mdash;himself, that is. As for his family,
well, he could always send some money home.</p>

<p>Anna was still up when he got back. He sat
down and commenced telling her about the meeting.
Also, that he was going away. He grew excited
again, but she did not seem to take in all he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
saying. There was something strange about her
this evening....</p>

<p>“I knew it all along,” was all she said.</p>

<p>She was still moving about when he rolled himself
in the bedclothes and laid his weary head on the
pillow. But suddenly a fresh quiver of raw pain went
through her. She staggered to the bed and dropped.</p>

<p>“Oh ... Egholm, it’s coming. You’ll have
to&mdash;go and fetch her now. You know where she
lives....”</p>

<p>Beyond her pain and fear, she felt for one brief
moment a blessed sense that this was <em>her</em> hour; she
was to be the centre of importance for once. It was
a victory.</p>

<p>Her husband, on his part, felt no share in anything
victorious. He roused her quickly to her senses.</p>

<p>“It’ll have to keep till to-morrow,” he said in
an offended tone. “You surely don’t mean to send
me running about now in the middle of the night?”</p>

<p>But it would not keep till to-morrow....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Egholm suffered considerably that night. A
couple of women whom he did not remember to have
seen before came up to assist the midwife, and took
possession of the place, relegating him&mdash;the master&mdash;to
the status of a slave. One handed him a bucket,
indicating simply that it was to be emptied in the
dustbin in the yard. He was not accustomed to
such errands, but went down the dark stairs meekly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
He had barely returned, when, shaken as he was, they
bade him run at full speed to the chemist’s. He
looked round helplessly for Hedvig and Sivert, but
the children had already been safely lodged with
Eriksens’ down below, out of the way. Egholm
went. He took it like a man. True, he wept, but
he did not scream aloud, as did his wife over her part.</p>

<p>Later on, towards morning, he was ordered to
find some tape. As the simplest way of searching,
he took his wife’s workbox and tipped it upside down.
He found no tape, but he found some crumpled
letters, which interested him as soon as he perceived
the signature was his own.</p>

<p>Egholm’s features writhed themselves into expressions
of disgust as he read the tender words, the
ardent longing, with which he had once written to a
certain “dearest Anna.”</p>

<p>There were even some verses dedicated to that
same Anna&mdash;“Dove of my heart....”</p>

<p>The verses in themselves were chiefly in praise of
Helsingør, Helsingør.... As through a mist Egholm
saw the two women who had played any part in his
life&mdash;Clara Steen, from Helsingør, and Anna, from
Aalborg. Once, the two had been as one in his mind&mdash;it
was at the time he wrote those letters. The
verses to Helsingør, dedicated to Anna, were proof
of it. And now&mdash;ah, now ... Clara, a silken-soft,
delicious dream, and Anna, a heavy, sighing, hollow-eyed
reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara&mdash;what of Clara now? No; she was forgotten.
All that Egholm remembered was the
picture of her on the wall of her father’s office. But
he remembered that only too well. Though it was
long now since he had seen it of nights....</p>

<p>Egholm, the weary, his night’s rest broken, his
hopes trampled under the butcher-boots of Karlsen
Junior, his past for years back a ravening hunt for
work; Egholm, the miserable, sank down on a chair
and buried his face in the litter from the workbox,
with the letters under it.</p>

<p>There was a bitterness in his mouth almost of
physical disgust....</p>

<p>As it grew light he stole out of the house. The
women were making coffee, with a great deal of
fussing about. He seemed to remember they had
come in once during the night, and showed him
a child. He had expected it, and showed no
surprise....</p>

<p>The walk out along the frosted roads did him
good.</p>

<p>That money for the camera must be found. Ten
<i>kroner</i>&mdash;after all, it was not a million. And he
<em>must</em> have them....</p>

<p>He came back home warm and cheerful, to find
the house in an atmosphere of rejoicing that fitted
well with his mood.</p>

<p>Anna lay there in bed with a splendidly clean
nightdress on, and a face younger by years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a blessing of things?”
she said, pointing round the room. “What do you
think that is? <em>Butter!</em> And there’s soup. Sit
down, you poor thing. Hedvig, make haste and dish
up a plate of soup. And Mother’s sent ten <i>kroner</i>.
Don’t say the day of miracles is past!”</p>

<p>“Why, that’ll pay for the journey!” Egholm
exclaimed, with emotion.</p>

<p>“Journey? What journey?”</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;well, you remember.... We said
before....”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” cried Anna, trembling. “You
mustn’t, Egholm. You mustn’t. God’s everywhere.
He can help you here as well. I haven’t been able
to be much to you lately, I know, but only wait
a little, and you shall see. With God’s help, I’ll be
up and about again in four days from now. I can
generally manage with four, you know.&mdash;Yes, I know
you always say the gipsies and that sort don’t need
to stay in bed at all, but then they’re more like
animals than human beings&mdash;heathen, at any rate.
Don’t go away now, Egholm; you see how I’ll work&mdash;oh,
you wait and see. And make money, and you’ll
get work, too, all right.”</p>

<p>“Never, in this beastly place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will. Listen. Last night, when it was
over, and the women had gone, I lay thinking of the
lovely boy the Lord had sent me. I felt such a
relief, and it was all so good and nice. It was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
four, I think. And just as I was dropping off again,
I saw a man with two bright eyes standing there by
the cradle....”</p>

<p>“A spirit, you mean?” said Egholm, with a
gasp.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.&mdash;Be careful, you’re spilling the
soup. I lay there quite quiet, and looked at him,
and he looked at me. I dared hardly breathe, for
fear he should vanish again. His eyes were ever so
big&mdash;and I can’t tell you what a gentle look in
them.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything?”</p>

<p>“He nodded several times, and then he said:
‘That boy is sent to help you.’ Oh, you can’t think
how lovely it was. When I woke up I could feel I
had been crying.”</p>

<p>“When you woke up&mdash;why, then, it was only a
dream.” Egholm was deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>“Dream? No; I wasn’t asleep, only just dozing,
I tell you. He stood there as plain and alive as you
are now.”</p>

<p>But Egholm went on with his soup. And he
had his way. He was to go off that very day. Sivert
was despatched to the pawnbroker’s for the camera,
and while he waited, Egholm was as gentle as could
be. His wife could not remember having seen him
so kind, not for years past. He took one of the
snowdrops from the bedside&mdash;Hedvig, with her
usual readiness, had stolen them from Eriksens’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
garden for her mother&mdash;and put it in his
buttonhole.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear, and take care of yourself,” said
Egholm, and kissed his wife on both cheeks.</p>

<p>Anna was touched at so much gentleness. The
tears flowed from her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII</h2>


<p class="firstpara">As Egholm came up to the station, he caught
sight of young Karlsen. He was pale, and
there was a cut on the bridge of his nose,
but his temper was of the best.</p>

<p>“Aha!” he said artfully, nudging Egholm with
his elbow. “Aha!” And he grinned.</p>

<p>That nudge, that grin, and that “Aha!” said
much. They seemed to imply that Karlsen and
Egholm had a pleasant&mdash;oh, a delightful little secret
between them.</p>

<p>“A nice way you treated me last night,” said
Egholm. He would have spoken more forcibly, a
great deal more forcibly, but his mind was distracted
by the thoughts of his journey. He had not yet
made his choice of where to go. And the world
was wide. “I hadn’t expected that of you&mdash;after
what you said. You know.”</p>

<p>“Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath. And&mdash;er&mdash;bless
them that curse you, and&mdash;er&mdash;put up
thy sword into its sheath, for.... Well, anyhow.
You see, the old man wouldn’t hear of it. It was
no earthly good. He said he’d resign first. Put
yourself in my place, my dear fellow. And then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
began to be doubtful myself, too, afterwards, about
it all. Come and have a drink. You look as if you
were going off somewhere. What’s on now?”</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;I’m going away,” said Egholm nervously.
“Going to open a photographic studio.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never,” said Karlsen, with ungrudging
wonder. “And where’s it going to be? You never
said a word about that before.”</p>

<p>“I had a studio once in Copenhagen&mdash;Østergade,
a splendid position. And customers accordingly.
Made any amount of money. This time I’m going
to try&mdash;er&mdash;Knarreby. Quite a nice little place,
don’t you think?”</p>

<p>(There! Now it was said.)</p>

<p>“Knarreby? Oh yes, first-rate.”</p>

<p>They went into the waiting-room. Egholm
carried the camera himself, Sivert following behind
him with the handbag.</p>

<p>“<i>Skaal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Egholm, and here’s to burying the
hatchet. Friends again now, aren’t we? We were
both a bit upset last night, and didn’t know quite
what we were doing. Turn the other cheek, what?”</p>

<p>“I was going to, only you were holding me
behind.”</p>

<p>“Ha ha! That’s good. Taking it literally, as
you might say. That’s very good. <i>Skaal!</i> Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
another of these. Yes; go on. I’m sure you
can.”</p>

<p>Egholm joined in the laugh at his own jest. Now
that he had finally decided, all was brightness and
freedom ahead. Away, away, like a bird that wakes
to find its cage suddenly open. He could feel no
anger against anyone now.</p>

<p>“Have a cigar,” said Karlsen. There was no
end to his amiability to-day.</p>

<p>“I don’t smoke.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you, though? I say, Egholm, I wonder
if you’d be above doing me a little favour?” Karlsen
bit off the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly.” Egholm dived willingly
into his pocket and pulled out a box of matches.</p>

<p>“Thanks&mdash;as a matter of fact, it wasn’t matches so
much I was thinking of. Another little matter....”
The match flared and flared.</p>

<p>Egholm happened to glance at the other’s face.
The bright black eyes, with a fan of wrinkles out to
the side, reminded him of fluttering cockchafers.
Why, the man was nervous himself! His hand was
shaking. And suddenly he brought the match too
close to his beard....</p>

<p>“Of all the cursed.... H’m. Well, never
mind.&mdash;Look here, Egholm, you couldn’t manage to
fix up another youngster at your place&mdash;a baby?
You’ve quite a crowd already; it wouldn’t be noticed.
It’s not mine&mdash;ha ha! No; it’s Meilby’s. I daresay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he’s told you.... Silly thing to do&mdash;playing with
fire....”</p>

<p>“But why should I....”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s just where it comes in. In the
first place, there’s no one I’d sooner trust with a
little angel like that, than you, my dear friends.
And, in the second place, it’ll be worth something to
whoever takes it, and I’d like you to have the money.
It’ll be paid for, and well paid for. See what I
mean?”</p>

<p>Egholm was alert in an instant. His heart was
bubbling over with gratified malice. He put on a
thoughtful expression as he took his ticket.</p>

<p>“Was it Meilby that put you on to me?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes and no. He comes to the meetings,
you know, so I’d like to help him if I can. I can’t
take the kid myself, you understand. The mother’s
in a dairy all day.”</p>

<p>“But about the money,” said Egholm, moving
towards the train. “What’s it worth?”</p>

<p>“Oh, any amount,” said the Evangelist. In his
delight at finding Egholm so amenable to his plan,
he forgot to restrain his play of feature. “Hundred
and fifty <i>kroner</i> at the least. Let him pay, the
beggar, it’s his own fault, and I’ll give him a talking-to.
I went up to his place just now, by the way, but he
wasn’t in.”</p>

<p>Egholm was in his seat. The train was ready to
start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you where he is,” said Egholm, with a
smile. “He’s on his way to America by now. I said
good-bye to him last night.”</p>

<p>Young Karlsen was not used to being made a fool
of. He collapsed as the train moved off; he waved
a clenched fist furiously after it, and shouted. Then,
turning to go, he discovered Sivert.</p>

<p>“What are you grinning at, you young devil?”</p>

<p>“He’s forgotten his bag,” said Sivert, shaking his
white mop of hair with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>But Karlsen found poor comfort in that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>




<h2>VIII</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Sivert stood in the smithy, trembling in every
limb each time the hammer clanged on the
iron plate. His mother had just gone, and
he was alone. The hammer crashed like thunder,
and he expected every moment to be struck by
lightning.</p>

<p>“Look to your work,” said the blacksmith.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm had shaken her head at first, when
she saw there was a boy wanted at Dorn’s smithy.
Sivert a blacksmith? Never. But as there was no
other job to be found in all Odense, and when Dorn
explained that he wasn’t a blacksmith really, but a
locksmith and general metal worker, she agreed,
albeit with some mistrust.</p>

<p>The boy stood holding a metal plate, his master
cutting through it along chalked-out lines. It was
to be a weathercock, in the shape of a horse. Suddenly&mdash;just
at an awkward turn&mdash;the plate slipped,
and the smith snipped off one lifted foreleg.</p>

<p>For a second or two he seethed like a glowing bar
of iron thrust into water. A box on the ears was not
enough....</p>

<p>“Here, Valdemar!” he cried to his man. “Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
hold of the little beast, and we’ll cut his fingers off.
That’s it. So!”</p>

<p>Sivert wriggled and screamed, and even tried
to kick. But the man behind only crushed him the
harder in his blouse-clad arms, till the boy’s limbs hung
limply down and his voice died to a hoarse gasp.</p>

<p>The smith opened the little white-knuckled
hand with a grip as if shelling peas, and drew one
finger between the shears, but managing carefully
so that the boy could wrench it away at the critical
moment.</p>

<p>This, of course, prolonged the joke, and made it
all the funnier.</p>

<p>The man, too, began to find it interesting; his
dull eyes glittered like molten metal newly set.
There was a kind of anticipation in his mind&mdash;he
realised that he would find considerable enjoyment
in having Sivert all to himself when they went up
to the bedroom they were to share at nights. It was
but a vague thought as yet, a blind and pale Proteus
moving uncertainly in the secret passages of his
mind.</p>

<p>At dinner, while master and man sat over their
porridge, Sivert was busy peeling potatoes for the
next course. He sat on the wood box out in the
kitchen, a tiny place, which was filled with the odour
of Madam Dorn. She was the hugest piece of womankind
Sivert had ever seen, and full of curious noises.
Every other moment there came a threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
rumble from within like an approaching hurricane&mdash;perhaps
she was hungry, too&mdash;then she would clear
her throat with a thick, full sound, that seemed
to rise from unknown depths. Sivert made the
surprising discovery that her posterior part resembled
a huge heart when she bent down. Was
that perhaps an indication of general kindliness?</p>

<p>Now and again she came over to where he sat,
and thrust her fingers down among the potatoes, to
see if there were enough done yet.</p>

<p>It was a long, long time before the kitchen door
opened, and the two superior beings within said,
“<i>Tak for Mad</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Not till then could Sivert fall
to upon the crumbs from their richer table&mdash;a
draggled herring and a few diseased potatoes.</p>

<p>“It’s a funny big world,” thought Sivert, “but
seems mainly alike in most things.” His father’s
thrashings had been delivered with more solemnity
than his present master’s clouts, but then, on the
other hand, Father would never have left a whole
herring.</p>

<p>He had just finished washing up when the smith
woke from his afternoon nap. “Kept up with him
that time,” thought Sivert, with some pride.</p>

<p>Evening came, after an endless day. Sivert had
had his supper, and was standing with the bucket of
leavings out by the pigs’ trough, when he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
journeyman striding out through the gate&mdash;a sight
to see, with his hat down over his eyes and a cigar
between his teeth pointing upwards. The boy wept
with emotion at seeing him go&mdash;<em>that strangling brute</em>.
Ah, the day was over now. He would have peace
at last. He could go to bed.</p>

<p>The pigs sniffed at the empty bucket, and grunted
encouragingly. Sivert was overjoyed with the pigs&mdash;he
had made friends with them already, after
dinner. There were two of them, one black.</p>

<p>He clambered up on the partition, and talked
confidentially to them about the events of the
day.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you think I’m crying, because I’m
not. Not a bit of it. I promised mother I wouldn’t.
I was only wiping my nose, and you thought I was
crying&mdash;ha ha, I did you there! And I’m not homesick,
no; only making a little invisible sound, the
same as when you’re homesick. It’s a trick I’ve
learnt, and it’s not everybody can do it. Just
listen.... No; you’ve got to be quiet. You make
worse noises than Madam Dorn. Homesick? What
for, I should like to know? Father in Knarreby?
I tell you I’m not fretting for him a single bit. Still,
he couldn’t do anything to me about the bag; he
never said I was to put it in the train.</p>

<p>“Homesick? For Hedvig, perhaps? She’s not
really warm to sleep with, you know, and she always
pulls the clothes off me. Oh, but of course you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
don’t know Hedvig. She’s my sister&mdash;a girl, you
understand....”</p>

<p>Sivert realised on a sudden that between his
knowledge and that of his hearers was a great gulf
fixed. He fell to laughing, and then shook his head
contemptuously.</p>

<p>“As like as not you don’t even know what sort
of thing a girl is at all. Poor silly pigs that you are.
Now, I know all the things there are in the world.
But I was stupid myself once.”</p>

<p>A little before eleven he clambered up to the
attic, his own bedroom, the one thing that had
tempted him most of all when his mother had pointed
out what he would gain by going out into the world,
instead of staying at home.</p>

<p>“And you’ll have your own room, with a big
bed you can turn about in whenever you like and
as much as you like, with no one to pinch you for
being a nuisance. And you can cut out pictures
and stick them up on the walls, and on Sundays you
can pick flowers and put them in water to last all
the week. And then when the mistress comes up
to make the bed, she’ll say: ‘Why, what a nice lad
we’ve got, now. Picking flowers....’”</p>

<p>He was much puzzled to find that there were <em>two</em>
beds, and neither of them made. Mistress must
have forgotten it. And what on earth was he to
do with two beds? Perhaps the boy they had had
before used to lie in one of them till it got warm;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and then shift over to the other. That way, of
course, you could keep them both warm. But....
No. Sivert decided not. Much better to save the
wear of them, and only sleep in one. Mistress, no
doubt, would appreciate that, and praise him for it.</p>

<p>He noticed, certainly, that there were some
clothes on a chair, and a trunk between one bed
and the window, but all unused as he was to the
ways of out-in-the-world, he thought nothing of it.
There were often things lying about at home here
and there. After much consideration, he chose one
of the beds, and sank to sleep.</p>

<p>Late that night came journeyman locksmith
Valdemar August Olsen home, quite appreciably
drunk. He stopped singing as he entered the
gate, and took off his boots at the foot of the stairs,
moved, no doubt, by some vestige of respect from
his apprentice days.</p>

<p>He did not seem to need a light, but sat down
on Sivert’s bed, talking softly to himself. Suddenly
he felt something alive under the bedclothes, and
started up, almost sobered by the fright. He fumbled
for matches, and a moment later was staring into the
face of a pale, whitish-haired boy, who sat up in bed
with wide, terror-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>Olsen waved the match till it went out, and threw
away the stump. The boy must not see him quake.
That bed there&mdash;it had been empty for three months
past, ever since Boy Sofus ran away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ha, frightened you, what?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Olsen called vaguely to mind the interesting
episode of the morning; he lit the lamp, and sat
down again on the edge of Sivert’s bed.</p>

<p>“No need to be frightened of me. I shan’t hurt
you.”</p>

<p>He thrust his hand under the bedclothes, and
stroked the child’s knobby spine. It gave him a
curious sensation, something promising and yet
uncanny. He had felt like that once before, when
he had bought a bottle of spirits for the night,
but mislaid it.</p>

<p>Drowsy as he was, but still obstinate, he sat like
a beast of prey, watching his time. Now and again
he sniffed at Sivert’s scalp&mdash;he had noticed the smell
of it that morning when he was holding him.</p>

<p>“What d’you want to have long hair like that
for?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sivert felt it would be dangerous to be at a loss
for an answer. And, diving swiftly into the primeval
forest growth of his mind, he snatched the first fruit
that came to hand.</p>

<p>“That’s for the executioner to hold on by, when
he’s cut off the body,” he said.</p>

<p>“Executioner&mdash;what the devil!&mdash;cut off the
body. It’s the head that’s cut off, stupid.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Sivert. “Not the body, then?”</p>

<p>But Valdemar August felt strangely confused in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
his mind. He tried again and again to see that
curious question clearly, but in vain. Then he gave
it up, and began talking at random of the days when
he was out on his travels, after ending his apprenticeship,
some ten years before.</p>

<p>He had passed through no end of towns, lodged
in all sorts of places. He told of it all in short,
descriptive sentences, always beginning with the
words: “And then....”</p>

<p>“And then we came over to Jutland&mdash;and then
we went down to Kolding&mdash;and then my mate said
... and then said I....”</p>

<p>He had set out on his travels with a receptive
mind, and had seen and experienced much. It was
not just ordinary things such as the position and
“sights” of the different towns that had impressed
him, but each place was associated with some new
and remarkable experience, vicious for the most part,
that came to his mind anew as soon as he named the
scene.</p>

<p>Sivert dropped off to sleep for a second at a time,
between the intervals of Olsen’s recurrent “And
then....” He understood but little of it all, but
was grateful to find no immediate prospect of thrashing
or strangling. If only he weren’t so sleepy, and
so horribly cold. And how long was it to last?
Olsen was telling now of an inn where they had
found a dead rat in a steaming dish of cabbage, and
of how they had paid the host in his own coin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed at the joyous recollection, and nudged
the boy in the ribs. His imagination grew more
fertile, he used ever stranger words, until at last
Sivert began to wake up, and feel amused. Evidently
this Olsen was a merry soul, though it was hard to
make him out at first.</p>

<p>Suddenly Olsen jumped up, and began dancing
about in the half-dark in his ill-mended socks, making
the queerest antics. Sivert took advantage of a burst
of laughter to bury his tired head among the pillows,
but a sudden silence made him open one eye warily
and peer out into the room.</p>

<p>Olsen was standing over him, looking wilder and
more incomprehensible than ever. Sivert was
paralysed with fear. He was about to scream, but
thought better of it&mdash;perhaps, after all, it was not so
bad but that he could turn it off with a grin. And
with an utmost effort, he broke into a fine imitation of
a hiccuping laugh.</p>

<p>Then Olsen’s rough hand closed over his mouth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2>IX</h2>


<p class="firstpara">What seemed most remarkable of all to Sivert
was that there was never anything strange
about Olsen’s manner in the daytime, even
when the smith was not there.</p>

<p>Olsen by day was simply brutal, like any ordinary
man; his eyes, that glittered so insanely in the
dark, looked out in daylight with a gleam of unadulterated
cruelty from under the brow they shared
in common. And the hand that stroked him so
affectionately could land out a blow that would make
his ears tingle all day.</p>

<p>For a time Sivert endeavoured to persuade
himself that it was merely nightmare. But there
were things that could not be so explained. And he
bore his horror alone, for his mother misunderstood
the hints he threw out, owing to the fact
that Sivert, as was his custom, assured her that
Olsen <em>did not</em> do so-and-so.</p>

<p>“I should think not, indeed. It’s wicked even
to think such things.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Then say your prayers properly and earnestly,
and God will help you all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say my prayers like anything, every night.
But Olsen’s ever so strong, and it’s no good. God
can’t manage him, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Sivert!”</p>

<p>“Or perhaps God doesn’t trouble about things
as much as people say.”</p>

<p>“Sivert, now be a good child, do. Do you
think God doesn’t trouble about us? Why, look,
what a lovely boy He’s given us now....” Fru
Egholm lifted the coverlet aside, to show the baby’s
face. “Isn’t he sweet? And so healthy he looks.
I think he’ll be fair haired.”</p>

<p>“But you promised me I was to be the only fair-haired
boy?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have as many of them as I can.
They’re the best sort. And, you know, Abel was
fair haired, but Cain was dark.”</p>

<p>“Just like Father!”</p>

<p>“Oh, child, how can you say such a thing!” Fru
Egholm chattered on to cover her confusion. What
a head the child had, to be sure.</p>

<p>The little one in the cradle awoke, and set up a
faint cry like the bleating of a lamb. His mother
took him up to her breast.</p>

<p>Sivert looked on with an expression of intense
disgust.</p>

<p>“That’s enough&mdash;that’s enough,” he said again
and again, his eyes straining awry in consuming
envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother, let’s break it up, let’s tear it to bits,
before it gets any bigger.”</p>

<p>“What do you think your father would say to
that?” said his mother, with a smile.</p>

<p>Sivert started; he had not thought of that
difficult side of the question.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we say it had got lost somehow?
No, I know; we’ll tell him there never was but me
and Hedvig. He won’t remember. And then we
can show him me, and ask if that’s the one he means.
Oh, may we, dear little darling mother?” And he
stretched out his hand for the child.</p>

<p>“Just listen and I’ll tell you what Father says,”
said his mother, feeling in a pocket of her dress.</p>

<p>Sivert’s face darkened; he stared anxiously at
the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Anna</span>,&mdash;Excuse my long silence, but
I have got things settled now, and every day feeling
happier for the change. Karlsen, the Evangelist,
has been a nightmare to me, but now I am awake
once more, and drink in the fresh air and feel myself
another man. And only fancy&mdash;<em>my powers of invention</em>,
that I thought were dead, have come back
again stronger than before. You remember I used
to say I was as <em>the hand of God</em> here on earth. I am
to go over the work, file away at it and make it even&mdash;in
a word, <em>improve the whole world</em>, that He created
great and rich and round, it is true, but rough at the
edges. In my innermost self, and right out to my
fingertips, I feel conscious of this as my calling. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
I only go for a little walk with the wind against me,
I feel my powers in urgent movement. Now, the
friction exerted by the wind could be reduced to
one-seventh by means of a little invention of mine.
I can tell you, there is a <em>great time</em> ahead. But it
is not this that occupies my mind just now, but
something else. A machine. I dare not set down on
paper what it is. Only this: be sure that all the
taps and other parts of the <em>steam wagon</em>, my old
construction, are sent to me here as soon as possible.
I must try my wings now; I feel myself free. Free
as a bird.”</p></div>

<p>“So I should think,” murmured Fru Egholm.
“With no wife and children or anything else to look
after. Well, thank goodness that’s not all.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe God Himself has led me to this place,
and guided my footsteps in the way.”</p></div>

<p>“Yes, I daresay&mdash;but who was it went down on
her knees a hundred times and prayed God to deliver
you out of that Angel creature’s claws?”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm knew the letter by heart from end
to end. Nevertheless, each line affected her now as
strongly as if read for the first time. Even then,
despite her critical opposition to the present passage,
she was already feeling for her handkerchief, ready
for the touching part she knew was just ahead.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have fitted up a splendid little studio in a
carpenter’s place. Do you think anyone in Odense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
would ever have given me credit for the rent, and
paid for a glass roof into the bargain and all that?
When I came into the town the first day, it was
like a triumphal march. I walked down from the
station with a man, and asked him if he knew a
place where I could put up. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘you
can stay at Vang’s hotel. My name’s Henrik Vang;
it’s my father owns the place.’ I shook my head,
thinking of my 3 <i>kroner</i> 50 that was all I had.
But he said I could fix my own price; he’d look after
that all right. Did you ever hear of such luck? We
spent the whole evening together, in the restaurant,
and all the notables of the town were there. He
told them to put it all on his bill. While I think
of it&mdash;be sure to send my embroidered waistcoat
and the small boots, if you can manage it. They’re
only in for a small sum, and you should be able to
get them out all right, now you haven’t got me to
feed....”</p></div>

<p>“Only a small sum! Heh! Embroidered
waistcoat and creaky boots&mdash;no, my good man, you
won’t get them, and that’s flat.”</p>

<p>But now came the part that filled Fru Egholm
with joy and pride. Egholm wrote that he had been
thinking much about the vision she had had on the
night the child was born. It would be as well to
give the child a name that should remind the Lord
of His promise. He would suggest <i>Emanuel</i>.</p>

<p>Was there ever such a thoughtful creature in
the world? And it was the first time Egholm had
ever troubled himself to think of a name for any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the children. But perhaps he was a different man
now. For he wrote further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The country round here is lovely. Only two
minutes’ walk from my studio down to the shore.
Might easily have a little sailing boat there, all ready
to hand. I often go down there, but only for a
minute at a time&mdash;there might be people coming
up while I was out. You must see and come over
soon. I am longing for you, dearest Anna....”</p></div>

<p>“And I’m longing, too,” said Fru Egholm, using
her handkerchief. “Man and wife should be one,
as they say. But what about you young ones?
Hedvig ought surely to be able to get a place in
Knarreby, no worse than the one she’s got. It’s you
that’s the trouble, Sivert lad.”</p>

<p>“Olsen’s a good enough hand at thrashing, but
I think Father beats him at using hard words,” said
Sivert judicially.</p>

<p>The matter was not one to be settled out of hand.
Money was not the only difficulty. Fru Egholm
had gradually worked up quite a decent business
connection with the sewing of grave-clothes. One
day she had made 1 <i>kroner</i> 67 <i>øre</i>, <em>net earnings</em>.
And a business like that was not to be lightly
thrown away.</p>

<p>Hedvig was getting on nicely, at school and in
her situation, and Sivert’s curious revelations grew
less frequent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, the boy suffered less now from the attentions
of his tormentor at the smithy than at first.
There were always the wonderful stories to begin
with, and these he took as a kind of compensation
for what followed. Olsen had also a book which
he would bring out on rare occasions. It was
a crumpled rag to look at, from the outside.
But within were marvels. Sivert’s eyes glowed
when Olsen took it out of the drawer. It was
his journeyman’s book, at once a passport and a
register.</p>

<p>Page after page, the stamp and signatures of the
police&mdash;the State Authorities, no less. One stamp
for every imaginable town.</p>

<p>Sivert was dumb with emotion. Even Olsen’s
voice shook. And in the middle of showing it, he
would sometimes snatch up the book with an oath
and hide it jealously against his naked breast, only
to draw it forth lovingly a moment later. It was
as if he could not bear the glorious vision for more
than a little glimpse at a time.</p>

<p>It was a treasure of almost inconceivable value,
was that book. Better to lose one’s own head than
that, for, once lost, the unfortunate owner would be
put in prison on the spot. On the other hand,
whoever held such a book, duly stamped and signed
and in order, might wander the whole world over,
and none should dare to touch a hair of his
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>In the front of the book was something more
wonderful even than the police stamps. Sivert had
been three times granted a sight of it. Nothing
less than a painting in words of the owner of the
book. The boy grew giddy at the thought that
in five years’ time he, too, might attain a like
distinction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="firstpara">
“Height&mdash;58 inches.<br />
Hair&mdash;black.<br />
Eyes&mdash;brown (eyebrows meeting in centre).<br />
Nose&mdash;ordinary.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Sivert turned his eyes from the book to the
living Olsen before him; it was a marvel that
anyone could have hit off the description thus to
a hair.</p>

<p>But then came the best of all:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="firstpara">“Any distinctive marks: <em>Has six toes on each
foot</em>.”</p></div>

<p>Olsen threw back his head, and set his lips
sternly. Yes, he had six toes; it was perfectly true.
And why shouldn’t he? What, didn’t believe it?
Well, then, look here!</p>

<p>Off came Olsen’s socks, and Sivert, in humble
amazement, counted the whole dozen. True, the
outermost toe was no giant, but rather a tiny blind
thing that clung to the next. There was no nail
to it, yet it was undoubtedly a toe. A whole limb
additional!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Sivert counted his own inferior equipment again
and again by night, and in course of time developed
a fine gift of counting them wrong.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they write down about your inside?”
he ventured to ask.</p>

<p>“They can’t. That’s private,” answered Olsen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2>X</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Henrik Vang loved a soft, easy seat, and
from his very first visit he had chosen to sit
down in the middle of Egholm’s iron bed.
Sometimes, when it was cold, he would pull the bedclothes
up over his legs, right to his throat. Egholm
did not mind. He preferred to walk up and down
the floor, listening to his own voice. It was rarely
but he had some new strange plan or invention in
his head.</p>

<p>To-day, however, he was nervous, and void of
ideas. Anna was coming by the midday train.
Consequently, he found nothing now to talk of but
old, worn-out themes. Of the Brethren, who had
cheated him out of all that money. Of his great
Day of Reckoning with those same Brethren, and
how they had risen up and cast him forth, together
with one Meilby, a photographer.</p>

<p>“He was something like you, Vang, by the way,
was Meilby. Same light hair, and eyes&mdash;and
especially in the look of them. Now, anyone not
seeing that great big body of yours would say you
weren’t grown up yet. But Meilby, he was younger,
and not so heavy built, perhaps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was he married?”</p>

<p>“No, but he....”</p>

<p>“Then he wasn’t like me.”</p>

<p>“Ha ha&mdash;but he was, though, on my word. The
voice, too. Same rumbling sort of way, as if that
wasn’t properly set either.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, he wasn’t married, so he wasn’t like me.
She’s been talking to Father again. Asking him to
turn me out. I don’t know if she wants me to die of
hunger. For she never gives me anything herself.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, Vang,” laughed Egholm,
“you’re not exactly a model husband, either.
Women like being made a fuss of now and then.
Now me, for instance. Here’s my wife coming to-day,
and what do I do? Go up to the station
myself to meet her. See?”</p>

<p>Egholm looked at his watch, and felt uncomfortable.
Again he had forgotten the time. The
train must be in by now, and Anna would be left
standing there, utterly strange to the place....</p>

<p>He left Vang in the nest he had made, and hurried
out.</p>

<p>Annoyance at the little misfortune was but a
herald for the host of black thoughts that had been
gathering in Egholm’s mind ever since the day when,
in a weak&mdash;a very weak&mdash;moment, he had written
to Anna to come.</p>

<p>Now, was it nice, was it decent of her, to take
advantage of a momentary lapse like that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyhow, it was too late now. The thing was
done. Good-bye to freedom&mdash;he had himself turned
back to seek his fetters. Anna would be there, right
enough, standing on the platform ready to clap the
handcuffs on him once more.</p>

<p>And now, just as things were beginning to move!
With a wife and two hungry children to drag about
after him, it would be stagnation once more, however
he might put his shoulder to the work.</p>

<p>The gravel path leading to the station had been
newly planted with trees, poor, scraggy things, more
like the brooms on the buoys outside the harbour.
And now they had to feel about with their roots
through the hard earth. It would be ages before
they grew to be tall and strong, with broad leafy
crowns. And they were young&mdash;but he was no
longer young, and his strength had been wasted
in many a barren soil.</p>

<p>Egholm clasped his hands under his cloak, and
prayed:</p>

<p>“Lord, spare Thy servant. Take away this cup
from me. Let it be so that, when I come to the
station, I may wake up out of a painful dream.
No wife and children at all. Lord, hear Thy
servant; hear him for that he suffered for the
sake of Thy word, at the hands of the Brethren
in Odense!”</p>

<p>He writhed his bony fingers, and looked up to
the blue March sky. How grateful he would be;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
how he would fall down and bend his forehead to
the earth, if his prayer should be heard!</p>

<p>But, alas, they would surely be there&mdash;Anna,
Sivert, and Hedvig. Yes; they would be there, never
fear.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to him that he could not
remember the children’s faces. All he could call to
mind of Hedvig was her keen grey eyes, and Sivert
was associated chiefly with the grating sound of a
little saw. But that sound was so vividly present
in his mind that he lashed out with his stick, by way
of relief. It was a reflex movement, a case of cause
and effect.</p>

<p>Egholm had expected to find his family on the
steps of the station, but there was no one there. The
whole place looked dead and deserted. The omnibus
horse stood drowsing in its tether, while the driver,
Red Jeppe, jested with the waitress at the bar. No
one on the platform but a group of girls. And it
was already half-past twelve by the clock.</p>

<p>Strange&mdash;very strange.</p>

<p>He drifted up to a porter, and asked:</p>

<p>“The train from Odense&mdash;has it come in yet?”</p>

<p>“She’s broken down at Aaby. A nasty mess.”</p>

<p>“Broken down!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Engine off the line, and....”</p>

<p><em>Oh!</em> Egholm felt a nasty blow at his heart.
So God&mdash;or was it Satan?&mdash;had heard his prayer
for once. With an ashy face he asked again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nobody hurt, I hope?” And the answer
seemed to flash on him as a vision: Anna stretched
out on a canvas bier, her thick hair matted with
blood.</p>

<p>“Hurt? Oh, Lord, no,” said the porter. “Only
the engine turned off down the wrong track, and
stuck in the gravel.” He yawned hungrily. “You’re
not the only one hanging about here waiting for
their blessed trains....”</p>

<p>Egholm felt a strange weakness in the legs, and
sat down. The signal bell rang&mdash;train due in ten
minutes. It seemed to him as if the station had
suddenly brightened up. Quite cheerful all at once.
Those girls there, for instance, with lovely new boots
on. And laughing all the time. The one on the
outside leaned right over to listen when the others
whispered. Well, well, a good thing everyone
wasn’t miserable.</p>

<p>And there&mdash;there was a man coming out of the
waiting-room&mdash;a tall, fat man with rather thin legs&mdash;a
commercial traveller. He didn’t look pleased at
all, but dragged at his two bags like a convict in
irons. Then, at sight of the girls, he stopped and
drew himself up, anxious to be seen.</p>

<p>He draws a mirror and a tiny brush from his
pocket, and wields them like a virtuoso. Then a
cigar-case, and next a smart little contrivance for
cutting off the end; another little case, with matches
in. Evidently he is trying to impress those girls with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
an idea that he is a sort of original chest of drawers,
with all manner of cases and shiny, interesting things
inside. And he succeeds. The girls stop talking,
and look at him, to see what will happen next. But
after a little they fall to laughing again.</p>

<p>When the train rolled in, Fru Egholm, standing
at the window of a compartment beyond the end
of the platform, saw her husband come running
down the length of the carriages, eagerly, with
delighted eyes.</p>

<p>Hurriedly she took leave of a couple of women
fellow-travellers. They had lived together for the
past three or four hours, and suddenly that was
over....</p>

<p>Egholm clambered up on the footboard, and
found a pleasant surprise. Sivert was not there!</p>

<p>True, there was little Emanuel, whom he had
forgotten altogether for the moment. But then
Emanuel was the child of victory. Or at least it
was reasonable here, as ever, of two evils to choose
the lesser.</p>

<p>Anna was a little puffy and dark under the eyes,
but her cheeks were flushed with excitement. She
and Hedvig handed out an endless array of packages,
a lamp, some pictures, and the family treasure&mdash;the
cut-glass bowl. One of the parcels was soft and
round, and Anna proffered it with a warning:</p>

<p>“Be careful; don’t lay it down anywhere. There
might come a dog....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm fingered it over, and made out the contours
of a fowl. His heart softened. And then, as
Anna stood feeling helplessly behind her with her
lace boots, he took her in his arms, helped her out,
and twisted her round. Her face was flushed with
confusion. The features he cared for hid those he
hated. For a second he read the anxious questioning
in her eyes, then a wave of deep sympathy overwhelmed
him, and he pressed her to him again and
again.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you’ve come, Anna, my dear, I’m
so glad.”</p>

<p>Omnibus-Jeppe was to take the heavier luggage
that was in the van.</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Jeppe, scratching the back of his
head, “there’s enough to stock a shop.”</p>

<p>Egholm scratched his head likewise, and stared
helplessly at the bundles of bedding and Anna’s
flower-pots&mdash;a whole score of them.</p>

<p>“What on earth d’you want to drag all that
about for?” he asked irritably.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! They’ve broken the calla there,”
wailed Fru Egholm, kneeling down beside it.
“Broken right down at the root. And it was just
coming out....”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that!”</p>

<p>“Give me a twenty-five <i>øre</i>, and I’ll look after
the lot,” said Jeppe, melting at once before feminine
grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The family had as much as they could carry.
Egholm walked with pictures under either arm; his
wife took the fowl, the cut-glass bowl, and the
flower-pot with the calla. Leave it&mdash;because it was
broken? No, she could never be so cruel.</p>

<p>Emanuel’s perambulator lay upside down, revealing
the advertisement placard for somebody’s beer
that had been tacked over the hole in the bottom.
Hedvig tipped it right side up. It would hold a good
deal, being of a peculiarly low, broad shape. Emanuel
was ultimately placed among the various goods there
disposed, as one surrounded by trophies in a triumphal
car. He sat looking round with big blue eyes under
his little white cap. It was a girl’s cap, really&mdash;a sort
of sunbonnet that had lain in a drawer since Hedvig’s
time, but&mdash;<i>Herregud!</i> what did it matter? At his
age....</p>

<p>Egholm walked in front, the pictures waving up
and down like a pair of wings as he described the
view with great enthusiasm to his wife.</p>

<p>The slow-moving flood of the Belt glittered in
newborn sunlight. The fields lay green and open
under God’s sky. The landscape looked one freshly
and boldly in the eyes&mdash;Anna marked how the very
air tasted utterly different from that about Eriksens’
sour little patch of yard and garden. Her husband
voiced her thought exactly when he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s a prettier spot in all the
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the town?” she asked in surprise. “Where
is it?”</p>

<p>“Right up there in the bay. See the red church-tower
there, and the Custom House&mdash;that yellow
place standing out against the great black woods?
The town’s as sheltered as a bird in its nest. And
look, that’s Jutland over there&mdash;see how close it
looks, and the two lines of coast all soft against each
other. Looks almost as if they were dancing.”</p>

<p>“And look at the white sails on the blue water!”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know that one with the topsail. That’s
Etatsraad Brodersen’s. You know, ‘Brodersen’s Pure
Grape.’ He’s the great man of the town.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely place.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but wait till it’s summer, and the beeches
are out,” said Egholm, with bright eyes. “We’ll go
out one day together. I’ll show you it all.”</p>

<p>Tears welled up into Anna’s eyes. What a
marvellous place was this Knarreby, that could so
change her husband altogether! Actually running
down the platform to meet them as if it had been
visitors of rank. And no grumbling or scolding
because the train was late.</p>

<p>Egholm was himself moved. He blinked his eyes
and looked away.</p>

<p>Out on the Belt, Brodersen’s cutter was cruising
about. It was on the water early this year. There&mdash;it
was tacking now. Stood for a moment straight
as a white church, and then off on the new tack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Heavens, how it heeled over! Why don’t they let
go the sheet? Ah, there she was up again! But
Egholm had somehow slipped out of his former
joyous mood, and said a trifle absently and wearily:</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a pretty place; that’s true.”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm did not notice his altered tone. She
found the moment opportune to put in a word for
one that had been left behind in Odense, one that
had stood on the platform in the early morning,
waving and waving, till he suddenly collapsed, as
if the ground had been snatched from under his
feet. Was he not to have a share in the promised
land?</p>

<p>“Sivert sent his love. He couldn’t come, of
course, poor child.”</p>

<p>“No, thank goodness!”</p>

<p>The mother started&mdash;it was the old voice again.
Her rejoicing had hurried her forward along a path
that ended in a morass&mdash;she must drag her steps back
now, uncertain of her way.</p>

<p>Listlessly she followed Egholm’s account of some
excursion of his own.</p>

<p>“We came round the point to an island that was
like a floating forest&mdash;Heireøen, it’s called. We put
in there, alongside a pavilion place, and had steak
and onions.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it dreadfully expensive&mdash;at a place like
that?” Anna’s voice was dull and joyless as her
own meals and the children’s had been every day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Sundays and weekdays alike, as far back as she could
remember.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It was Henrik Vang that paid.
That is to say&mdash;he knew the man who kept the place,
and so....”</p>

<p>“Henrik Vang? Oh, that’ll be the one you
wrote about. His father’s got a little eating-house
or something.”</p>

<p>“Little eating-house! Good Lord!&mdash;the finest
hotel in the place. First-class restaurant!”</p>

<p>Anna had no grounds for disapproval, but, none
the less, she murmured:</p>

<p>“H’m. A fellow like that....”</p>

<p>The family had reached the outskirts of the town.
As they walked on, curtains were moved aside, and
a nose-tip here and there showed through. In the
little shops, the shopkeepers dropped their paper
bags and crowded with their customers to see.</p>

<p>Hedvig enjoyed being thus a centre of attraction.
She arranged the newspaper-holder, the plaster
figure, and the lamp in a specially attractive fashion,
drew herself up, tossed her head, and only wished
they might have to walk all through the town. As
it happened, she was disappointed.</p>

<p>Egholm, whose fingers were getting sore with
holding the pictures, tripped on faster.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;that’s where I live,” he said, out of
breath. “Pick up your legs a bit, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“The grey house there, with the gateway.”</p>

<p>All else was forgotten now in the anxiety to see
the place that was to be their home. It was a long,
low house. A gateway, two narrow shop-windows,
a door, and four pairs of windows beside. Over the
entrance was a placard inscribed with black letters
on a white ground: “<i>H. Andreasen. Coffins and
Funeral Furnishings.</i>”</p>

<p>A very respectable house it was, plastered with
cement. And now they could see the show-case
on one side of the entrance, with the photos in. No
dream, then, no misunderstanding. It was here they
were to live.</p>

<p>“Lord, isn’t it fine!” cried Hedvig.</p>

<p>Anna sighed resignedly, even perhaps in relief.</p>

<p>Saw and plane stopped suddenly. The men
wiped the cobwebs from the panes and looked out,
their bare arms gleaming against their blue overalls.</p>

<p>Anna hurried in through the entrance, but
stopped inside, and looked back at her husband
inquiringly.</p>

<p><em>There was someone in there!</em> She could feel it,
and it made her ill at ease. She was ready to drop
as it was, from weariness, and longed to hide herself
between four walls, to get her breath in peace, and
set about to make things comfortable for her husband,
the children, and herself.</p>

<p>“What are you waiting for? Go along in&mdash;the
door’s open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“But there’s someone ... I thought I....”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be Vang, I suppose,” said Egholm,
opening the door himself. “Hullo, Vang, here we
are again. Nobody been, I suppose? No, no.
Well, here’s my little party.”</p>

<p>Vang was seated in the middle of the bed, with
his hat on, and a cold cigar at one corner of his
mouth. The bed had sunk under the weight of
his heavy frame; the dirty sheets and spotted
blankets were twirled up as by a waterspout.</p>

<p>“My husband wrote about you,” Fru Egholm
stammered with an effort. She stood holding her
flower-pot and her parcels as if dreading to soil the
paint of table and seats.</p>

<p>“Him and me,” said Vang in a solemn bass,
letting his chin fall forward on his chest&mdash;“him and
me we’ve been as one. But I’m going now, all
right.”</p>

<p>“Why, what for?” said Egholm, touched.
“There’s no need....” He took Vang’s arm.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I must. Henrik Vang can’t stay where
there’s women about.”</p>

<p>“What’s turned you so serious all at once?”</p>

<p>Vang smoothed the bedclothes, evidently embarrassed.</p>

<p>“It’s not just making a fuss, to be asked again.
I know I’d rather stay. Where should I go to,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“You’ve a charming wife at home,” said Egholm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mischievously. “But stay here if you like. I’ll be
only too pleased.”</p>

<p>“Home? I’d rather walk in water up to my
neck the rest of the day. But if you really mean
it&mdash;if you’ll let me stay where I am&mdash;still as a mouse,
and never disturb a soul, why, I’d just love it.”</p>

<p>“Do, then, Vang, do.”</p>

<p>Vang turned with a smile towards Fru Egholm,
who was removing her hat in silence at the farthest
corner of the room.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay, then, just as I am, in what I’ve got
on. My clothes aren’t much, anyway. And I’m
mostly drunk as well. But when you get to know
me, <i>Frue</i>, you’ll see that right down inside I’m the
man I am. Son of Sofus Vang. First-class hotel,
excellent cuisine, and choicest wines&mdash;with terrace
overlooking the water!”</p>

<p>Hedvig burst out laughing. She and her mother
began carrying in the things Omnibus-Jeppe had
piled up outside.</p>

<p>Egholm saw how he and Vang were gradually
being immured behind the various belongings. It
even seemed to him that now and then something
was thrust with unnecessary harshness against his
legs, and a threatening look crept into his eyes. In
the midst of a flow of speech addressed to Vang,
he broke off suddenly, and said in a voice of
command:</p>

<p>“Take that stuff into the other room!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will, dear. Let me,” said Fru Egholm. “But
it looked like rain, you know.”</p>

<p>“Not that door,” said Egholm angrily.</p>

<p>“But these are the kitchen things.” Fru Egholm
had already seen that the other door opened into
an attic or box-room or something of the sort. “Isn’t
that the kitchen there?”</p>

<p>“Kitchen! That’s my dark-room.” Egholm
spoke as might a God to whom creations are the
merest trifle. The place might have been a kitchen.
Well and good&mdash;Egholm spoke the words: “Let
there be a dark-room.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to manage in there&mdash;at any rate,
for the present.” He nodded towards the nondescript
apartment opposite. “Make that a
kitchen.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear....” Fru Egholm pulled herself
together with a poor attempt at a smile. Then
she shook her head; it was hopeless to try to explain
to the uninitiate what a little world in itself a kitchen
is. “The stove....” she managed to protest.
“There’s not even a heating-stove in there.”</p>

<p>She waited still, with the chest of utensils in her
hands, before the forbidden door. She <em>must</em> get in
there.</p>

<p>Egholm reflected that it was perfectly true about
there being no stove. It was for that reason he had
had his bed in here for the winter. He could find
no way out of the difficulty, and grew furious&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
even he was not so far almighty as to create a kitchen
where no kitchen was.</p>

<p>“All right, get along with you, then?” he said,
pushing her in, and Hedvig, with Emanuel in her
arms, behind her. “There you are! But mind!
No fooling about with any of my things!”</p>

<p>The door opened with a queer sucking noise&mdash;it
had been caulked with strips of cardboard and cloth.</p>

<p>Hedvig and her mother stood aghast, while
Egholm thrust past them and began moving his
bottles with the easy familiarity of habit.</p>

<p>All the windows were darkened but one, that
glared red as a furnace door. They could see nothing
save their own hands, which looked strange and uncanny
in the red light.</p>

<p>“Egholm, you surely don’t mean to say we’re
to do the cooking here? When you can’t see your
hand before your face!”</p>

<p>Egholm stepped across and shut the door behind
them; then, turning to his wife, he brought his face
close down to hers, and whispered in a voice that
seethed like a leak in an overheated boiler:</p>

<p>“Look here! You’re not going to come along
and ruin the business for me now, so don’t you think
it. If I can see to do my developing, you can see
to cook. You understand?”</p>

<p>And he went on with a further flow of words,
furious, though subdued.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm writhed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Egholm ... there’s no <em>room</em>! I can’t
even see the stove.... Oh....”</p>

<p>She still clung to a faint hope that he might be
brought to see things with her eyes, and realise how
unreasonable it was to ask her.</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll give you a lamp. My dark-room
lamp should be about here somewhere.”</p>

<p>His fingers moved among rattling bottles on the
stove.</p>

<p>“Here it is&mdash;no. Now, where the devil....”</p>

<p>A bottle upset; he grasped at it hurriedly and
knocked over another; the liquid gurgled out into a
pool on the floor.</p>

<p>“A basin&mdash;quick, give me a basin! My silver
nitrate ... quick, a basin!”</p>

<p>They reached about for one in haste and
confusion.</p>

<p>“Open the door so we can see!” cried Hedvig.
But at the same moment her father came towards
them. His face looked as if smeared with blood in
the light from the red-covered pane; his teeth
showed between parted lips.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you’re the serpent in the garden!” he
hissed.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” she cried, her voice rising to a
scream.</p>

<p>Emanuel was beginning to cry. Hedvig tried to
wriggle through with him to the door, but stepped
on the basin her father had just set on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much for Egholm. He felt he must
either discharge the current within, or be fused by it,
like an overcharged wire.</p>

<p>He staggered one step back, then forward again.
His arms rose up as if with an inner force of their
own; then with his full strength he struck his clenched
fist in his wife’s face.</p>

<p>Once again, and once again he struck, the flesh of
her checks squelching under the blows. Then he
stumbled out, and closed the door carefully behind
him.</p>

<p>Vang was seated on the bed exactly as before.
What could he say to him? It was the first time
any stranger had witnessed a scene of this sort. What
was the use of starting upon heart-rending explanations,
which Vang would never understand? And
how much of the trouble had been audible through
the close-padded door?</p>

<p>Vang gets to his feet; he must go now&mdash;yes, he
must. There is something cowed about him; he
speaks in a low voice, and does not look up. And
Egholm, suddenly aware of Anna’s sobbing and
Hedvig’s uncontrolled blubbering plainly heard
through the door, realises that Vang must have been
able to follow the drama through all its painful
details.</p>

<p>And now he is going off, convinced that Egholm
is a cruel, cruel brute.</p>

<p>It must not be! Egholm feels now, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
strongly than ever before, that he <em>can</em> be so good, so
good!</p>

<p>“No, no; you mustn’t go!” he cries, as Vang
steps cautiously over the bath full of flower-pots.
He grips him by the arm, anxious to prove his all-embracing
affection on the spot. “You mustn’t go
now I’m in all this mess. Didn’t you say we’d been
as one together? Wait a bit; there’s something I
want to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>Egholm sat down on a ragged mattress, and
covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>If only he had something&mdash;some precious gift&mdash;to
offer Vang. But he had nothing&mdash;not a copper
<i>øre</i> in his pocket; not a thing. Not so much as a
bite of bread for himself, still less for Vang. And
what about the others?...</p>

<p><em>The fowl!</em> The thought of it seemed to flow like
something rich and soft and fat right out to his
fingers. He straightened himself up and looked
round&mdash;yes, there it was, in the perambulator.</p>

<p>“I was going to ask you to supper, Vang. My
wife’s brought a fowl along, a fine fat bird, almost
as big as a drake. But I suppose you’ve something
better for supper yourself?”</p>

<p>He gauged Vang’s hunger by the rumbling of his
own empty paunch, and made every effort to persuade
him.</p>

<p>“A fine bird, a delicious bird; the size of a
drake as nearly as can be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm was not quite sure whether a duck or a
drake would be the larger, but took the word as it
came into his head, to help him in his need.</p>

<p>Vang could not resist. He smacked his lips, and
said:</p>

<p>“I could go down to Father’s place, of course.
They can’t refuse me anything there, after all,
though they do keep me waiting and make things as
uncomfortable as they can. If only I could be sure
your wife wouldn’t mind....”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, not a bit,” said Egholm cheerfully,
relieved that all was well again. He had been cruel,
by an unfortunate chance, but now he had wiped
that out. Briskly he took up the parcel with the
delicious bird, and even played ball with it as he
went towards the dark-room door. The business in
there before sickened him unspeakably.</p>

<p>There was a moment of deadly silence as he
opened the door, but hardly had he taken a step
forward when he ran against a shadow that would
not let him pass. Next moment he felt Hedvig’s
skinny hands like claws, one at his chest, the other
gripping his throat, as she hissed out:</p>

<p>“You dare to touch Mother again&mdash;you dare!
Quick, Mother, take Emanuel and run!”</p>

<p>Egholm was more astonished than angry at first.
What was all this?</p>

<p>But&mdash;ugh! it hurt! He tried in vain to wrest
her hands away; then he struck at her head. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
she ducked down between his arms and butted him
over against the stove.</p>

<p>“Run&mdash;run quick! I’ve got him!”</p>

<p>“Let go, you little devil!&mdash;oh, help! she’s
strangling me!”</p>

<p>“Hedvig, what are you doing?&mdash;Hedvig, dearest
child! Let go, do; it’s your father!” Fru Egholm
tried to pull her off.</p>

<p>Then Hedvig realised that the day was lost. She
loosened her hold, and let Mother and Father wrest
an arm to either side, till she stood as if crucified up
against the wall, her head drooping, and yellow wisps
of hair falling over her flushed face. And she fell
to crying, with a horrible penetrating wail.</p>

<p>Egholm had still by no means recovered from his
astonishment. He coughed, and began rubbing his
neck, speculating the while on some appropriate
punishment for the presumptuous girl.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a nice little beast, you are,” he
said. But he could hardly find more to say. There
were not actually words in the language for criminals
of that sex.</p>

<p>“You overgrown hobbledehoy, falling upon your
own father, your own flesh and blood. I never heard
of such a thing. If you had your deserts, you’d be
bundled off to gaol this minute, you disgraceful young
scoundrel.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he began tearing down the planks and
cardboard from the window, without a word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
explanation, but with emphatic jerks and crashes that
fell in time to his words and gave them added weight.</p>

<p>“You wait&mdash;I shan’t&mdash;forget, you&mdash;squat-nosed&mdash;little&mdash;guttersnipe.”</p>

<p>But for every tug at the flimsy covering, the light
poured in more violently, like a wonderful grace of
God. Both Hedvig and her mother, despite their
indignation, could not help craning their necks to
look, as the corner of a garden, with budding trees,
came moving, as it were, towards them. Even
Emanuel opened his eyes wide, and lifted his little
hands towards the light.</p>

<p>Once he had begun, there seemed no end to
Egholm’s willingness to oblige. He cut the string
by which the door was fastened, and tore away the
padding from all sides.</p>

<p>“There! <em>Now</em>, are you satisfied?” he asked,
with great politeness.</p>

<p>But there was something wanting yet to render
his wife’s satisfaction complete. Those bottles....
All along the shelves and dresser were rows of bottles,
in every shape, thickness, and colour. Many of them
were ticketed with complicated chemical names, and
some bore the awe-inspiring death’s-head poison
label. Egholm had strung a tangle of lines from
wall to wall, on which his photos hung to dry, exactly
as when Hedvig played dolls’ washing-day.</p>

<p>And the kitchen table was a veritable map of
stains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“They cost something, those did,” said Egholm.
“That’s my silver nitrate.” And he seemed as
proud as if he had paved the way for his wife’s arrival
with pieces of eight.</p>

<p>He helped to set the numerous bowls and glass
plates aside, and murmured regretfully:</p>

<p>“Well, well, anyhow, you’ve had your way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but....”</p>

<p>“I hope you can see now, at any rate. And now,
for Heaven’s sake, make haste and get that fowl done.
I’ve asked Vang to supper.”</p>

<p>“But, Egholm! You don’t mean to say....”
Fru Egholm almost screamed.</p>

<p>“Beginning again, are you?” he said threateningly.
But at sight of her face, bruised and already
colouring from his recent blows, he turned away.</p>

<p>“We must do something for him. He’s been a
help to me from the first day I came. And he’s got
a miserable home.”</p>

<p>“We’ve neither knives nor forks&mdash;we haven’t
even plates.” Fru Egholm dared not say too much
just now, but hurried to unpack a box, that the contents
might speak for her. There were a few cups
without handles, five or six plates, some of them
soup-plates, but no two alike. One had a pattern of
flowers, another birds; a third was ornamented with
a landscape. Two of the knives lacked handles, and
nearly all the forks were one prong short.</p>

<p>“There! I don’t know what you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm was on the point of breaking out again,
but suddenly he laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, an elegant dinner service. Splendid!
splendid!” And he danced about the floor.</p>

<p>“We haven’t a single dish, or a tureen. And his
father keeps a real hotel&mdash;we can’t serve it up in the
saucepan.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you can. Vang and I, we’re not the
sort to stand on ceremony. Wait a minute, though&mdash;a
dish ... I can let you have a dish.”</p>

<p>He picked up a big white rinsing-dish from among
his own equipment, fished up some plates that were
lying in the bottom, and tipped the liquid into a
bottle.</p>

<p>“There you are&mdash;real porcelain. Now the set’s
complete. But mind you wash it out well, or you’ll
send us all to kingdom come. And, for Heaven’s
sake, make haste. I’ve got to keep talking to him all
the time, and you’ve no idea what a business that is.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Egholm danced out of the doorway,
leaving his wife, confused and helpless, with the
dripping poison dish in her hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>




<h2>XI</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Hedvig sat in front of the stove, crumpling up
newspapers and thrusting them in through
the open door, to keep the fire from going
out entirely.</p>

<p>“This will never do,” said her mother, wringing
her hands. Egholm was tramping up and down in
the next room, stopping every now and then to open
the door and ask if the supper wasn’t nearly ready.
His face was pale&mdash;he was always most dangerous
when he was hungry.</p>

<p>“Huh! Let them wait,” said Hedvig.</p>

<p>“Run outside, dear, and see if you can’t find
some bits of something&mdash;a piece of board or some
twigs or anything that’ll burn. I fancy I saw some
stuff under that bush in the corner.”</p>

<p>Hedvig was always happiest when she found a
chance of using her legs. She explored the yard
across and across, quartering like a hound in all
directions, and finding not a little in the way of fuel.
When she had filled her apron, there was a knocking
at one of the windows. At first she tried to ignore
it, and was hurrying in with her findings, but the
knocking was repeated, and more loudly. She turned
angrily and looked in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>A brown-eyed young workman in the carpenter’s
shop stood beckoning to her, both hands full of
beautiful lumps of newly cut wood.</p>

<p>This was a language Hedvig understood; she
picked up her heels and ran to the workshop door.</p>

<p>“You the photographer’s?” he asked, with a
bashful grin and a slight lisp in his voice, as he laid
the blocks like an offering in her apron.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hedvig. “We haven’t had time to
get in any wood as yet. Mother and I only came
to-day. We’re going to have chicken soup for dinner.
There’s visitors.”</p>

<p>“But what are the bones for?” said the man,
picking about among the contents of the apron.</p>

<p>Hedvig flushed, but, ready witted as ever, answered,
laughing:</p>

<p>“Oh. Perhaps you don’t do that here. In
Odense we always use bones for the fire when we can
get them. They burn almost better than wood.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Hedvig Egholm. And what’s yours? You’re
the carpenter’s son, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m only working here, that’s all. My
room’s just at that end&mdash;like to come and see it?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I must make haste in.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, come this evening, or to-morrow.
Will you?” he asked eagerly, routing about in all
the corners for more wood.</p>

<p>But Hedvig only laughed, and shook her heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
yellow plaits. She came back to her mother with
a load that reached to her chin. There was no need
to use the bones, after all&mdash;they burnt well enough,
it is true, but stank abominably in the burning.</p>

<p>Emanuel was given a row of the neat wooden
blocks, set up on the table before him.</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;there’s the puff-puff,” said Hedvig.</p>

<p>The child laughed all over his face, but a moment
later he was nibbling at the engine.</p>

<p>In the next room Egholm was still talking about
the manifold vicissitudes of his life.</p>

<p>He had started as a grocer’s assistant in Helsingør,
then in Aalborg; after that he had been a photographer,
in the time of the war, when the Austrians
were there. He had made a fortune, but it had
vanished in an attempt to double it, in Göteborg,
Sweden, where there was no photographer at that
time at all. Then on to Copenhagen with but a few
small coins remaining, and, despite this adverse
beginning, the possession of the biggest photographic
studio in the town a few months later.</p>

<p>This was Egholm’s <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>; he had told
the story of it a hundred times. And by frequent
repetition, it had gained a certain style, as he omitted
more and more of the commonplace. He told of
his bold advertisements&mdash;a new departure altogether&mdash;his
growing staff of assistants, the eagerness of the
public to come first, and the tearful envy of his
competitors. And when, in the flight of his telling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
he reached its highest point, where he really was
the greatest photographer in the place&mdash;he stopped.
He felt he must remain there on those heights, above
the clouds; he wished his hearers always to remember
him as there and so. The miserable descent he
passed over, and began as a matter of course with
his appointment on the railways, as station assistant,
at a wretched rate of pay.</p>

<p>Vang did not seem to miss the intervening
chapters; he sat wallowing in the delicious smell of
cooking that came through from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Egholm told of his railway period, how he had
rushed about the country, now at some desolate
little station on the Jutland moors, now in big places
like Odense or Frederikshavn. He sighed, and passed
over the conflicts with authority, and his dismissal.
No, he would not think of those things now; not
a thought. He turned abruptly to the annals of the
Brethren of St. John. True, there was much that
was disappointing about his relations with that community,
but, after all, there had been something
grand in its way about the final meeting. Had he
not stood there alone, and told them the truth, in
such a wise that even the fellow from Copenhagen
had polished his glasses and shaken in his shoes,
finding nothing to say in return? Had he not gained
the victory? They had thrown him out&mdash;but was
not that in itself sufficient evidence that his words
were true, and had pierced them accordingly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and then I heard a shout from someone
down by the door; it was Meilby. You know, the
photographer I used to teach English. He was
rather like you, by the way, Vang&mdash;the same gentle
sort of eyes....”</p>

<p>Augh! Egholm realised suddenly that he had
said that once before to-day. He had got to the
end of his repertoire. A sense of shame came over
him, he cleared his throat, and cried in a forced
voice:</p>

<p>“Hi, Anna! Vang says he’ll have his money
back if the performance doesn’t begin very soon.”</p>

<p>Vang grunted; that was the sort of thing he
understood. But Fru Egholm shivered in fear.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, in a minute&mdash;five minutes more!
Hedvig, for Heaven’s sake, look and see if it’s nearly
done?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s peeling now,” reported Hedvig, and
her mother left the horseradish to go and taste
the soup. <i>Herregud!</i> it was as weak as ditchwater.
She closed her eyes, and tasted once again, looking
very much like a blinking hen herself. “Ditchwater,
simply!”</p>

<p>“Hedvig!” She routed out a pocket-handkerchief,
and untied a twenty-five <i>øre</i> from one corner.
“Run out and get a quarter of butter, there’s a
dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what then?” she said sullenly to herself.
“It’s got to be used, and I’m not sorry I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it. Egholm always likes his things a little on the
rich side, and now after he’s been so angry....”</p>

<p>It was hard to please him anyway when he was
in that mood. Who would have thought he could
have turned so furious just for a little remark like
that?... What was it now she had happened to
say?</p>

<p>Her brain was puzzling to remember it as she
bustled about the final preparations. She talked to
herself in an undertone, weeping silently the while.</p>

<p>“Anna, what do you think you’re doing out
there?” cried Egholm.</p>

<p>Hedvig answered with a brief, sharp word, which
her mother tried to cover with a “Sh!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear&mdash;yes,” she called.</p>

<p>At the last moment she had hit upon a new and
ingenious plan for saving her housewifely credit.
The soup could be served up in the plates outside,
and brought to table thus; the nasty dish thing
could be used for the fowl itself. Fortunately, Vang
might not know it was a developing tank at all.</p>

<p>Hedvig carried Vang’s plate in, walking stiffly as
a wooden doll, and biting her lips till they showed
white. But Vang, with a single friendly tug at her
pigtails, made her open her mouth at once.</p>

<p>She laughed, showing her fresh white teeth. That
was Hedvig’s way.</p>

<p>Vang gulped down the hot soup with a gurgling
noise like a malstrøm. Egholm looked across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
nervously and enviously, and when Hedvig came
round behind his chair, he reached out backwards
greedily, but was sadly disappointed. No second
helping&mdash;only the big geranium that Hedvig had
brought in to set in the middle of the table. This
was her mother’s last brilliant effort; no one could
see now that the plates were not alike. She had even
fastened paper round the pot, as if it were a birthday
tribute.</p>

<p>They ate in silence, but when the dish was empty,
and each was wrenching at his skinny, fleshless wing,
Vang let off his long-restrained witticism:</p>

<p>“Egholm, what do you say? Can a chicken
swim?”</p>

<p>“Swim? A chicken? Why, I suppose so&mdash;no,
that is, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, shall we try if we can teach it?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t quite follow.... And, anyhow
there’s only the ghost of it left now, ha
ha!”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s time yet, for it’s fluttering about
just now in this little round pond just here!” Vang
rose heavily, as if from repletion, snorting with
delight at the success of his little joke, and drew a
circle with one finger over the front of his well-expanded
waistcoat. “All we want’s a drop of
something for it to practise in!”</p>

<p>Hedvig was dispatched to buy <i>akvavit</i> with the
few coins Vang found in his pockets; he gave her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the most precise instructions as to which particular
brand it was to be.</p>

<p>Egholm never drank with his meals as a rule, but
that evening he took three glasses of the spirit, though
it burned his throat like fire. Vang made no attempt
to force him, but simply said “<i>Skaal!</i>” and tossed
off his glass.</p>

<p>Egholm, however, had other reasons.</p>

<p>He had fancied he could <em>eat</em> himself into oblivion,
and was trying now&mdash;with just as little effect&mdash;to
drink his trouble away. But it only grew the
worse.</p>

<p>It was Anna’s eyes that would keep rising up
before him.</p>

<p>Anna’s grey-green eyes, with their frightened
look, in a setting of swollen, blue, and bloodshot
flesh, that hung in pouches down on either side of
her nose.</p>

<p>It was not that he felt remorse for what he had
done; that did not cost him a thought. But the
effects of it&mdash;those <em>eyes</em>&mdash;haunted him now, following
him everywhere he turned, relentlessly, cruelly.
He writhed, and sighed, overflowing with self-pity
for his troubles.</p>

<p>Eating did not help him, drinking was equally
futile; there was but one thing to do, then&mdash;to start
talking again, before it grew worse. It was nothing
to what it might be yet. And Egholm launched
out into a sea of talk, diving into it, swimming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
into it, hoping to leave the thing that followed him
outdistanced on the shore.</p>

<p>“And the money I made in Aalborg when the
Austrians were there&mdash;you’ve no idea. My studio
was simply besieged by all those black-bearded soldiers
with their strings and stripes&mdash;and they’d no lack of
cash, I can tell you. But then while they were
sitting about waiting, there would come some slip
of a lieutenant and turn the whole lot of them out
to make way for him. And one dirty thief I remember
that wouldn’t pay&mdash;between you and me,
the photos were not much good, and that’s the truth.
Showed him with three or four heads, you understand.
But the General simply told him to pay up
sharp, if he didn’t want his brains blown out. And
that settled it. The General, of course, was a particular
friend of mine. I’ll tell you while I think
of it. It was this way. He wanted his photo taken,
of course, like all the rest of them, but he must have
it done up at the castle itself, in the great hall, and
that was as dark as a cellar. I managed to get him
out on the steps at last, though he cursed and swore
all the time, and hacked about on the stone paving
with his spurs. All the others got out of the way&mdash;sloped
off like shadows&mdash;and there was I all alone
with him, in a ghastly fright, and making a fearful
mess of things with the camera. The interpreter
had vanished, too. Then, just as I was ready, at the
critical moment, you understand, I rapped out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
German, ‘Now! Look pleasant, please!’ All
photographers used to do that, you know, in those
days. I said it without thinking.</p>

<p>“You should have seen him. First he swore
like the very devil; you could almost see the blue
flames dancing round him. But then he burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“He wanted me to go back to Austria with him.
Tried all he knew to get me to go.”</p>

<p>Egholm sighed, and gazed vacantly before him,
trying if the vision that haunted him were gone.</p>

<p>... Eyes, eyes. Eyes full of terror, set in
patches of bruised flesh, and a drop of congealed
blood just at the side of the nose....</p>

<p>He sprang violently to his feet, and started talking
about Göteborg. The canals, where the women did
their washing, the park, Trädgården, and Masthugget,
where he had been out one Sunday. He
talked Swedish, and gave a long account of a funeral&mdash;Anna
had lost one child in Göteborg&mdash;the first.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Vang was quietly getting to the
bottom of the bottle, and when at last Egholm, weary
of his desperate fluttering on empty words, flung
himself down, Vang felt that it was <em>his</em> turn to speak.</p>

<p>“Ahem!&mdash;seeing no other gentleman has risen
Henrik Vang now begs to propose: ‘The Ladies.’
My friend, my old and faithful friend, wake up and
listen to my words. You have honoured me. You
have invited me to share your board. The supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was good&mdash;rather tough, that fowl, but, after all,
that’s neither here nor there. In a word, you have
done me a great honour, and I propose then to
honour you in return. My friend, my old and faithful
friend, you are a <em>man</em>. You can assert yourself,
and get your own way. But Henrik Vang, he can’t.
And I ask you now: How shall we gain the mastery
over woman? There! That, my friend, is the
problem&mdash;the problem of the future.”</p>

<p>“But is it true that she knocks you about?”
asked Egholm, grasping eagerly at anything to turn
the current of his own thoughts.</p>

<p>“Sh! Wait. Let me. I’ll tell you the whole
story, from the time when she was parlourmaid at
the house. I was only a boy, really&mdash;it was just
after Mother had died. No&mdash;I won’t begin there,
though. Nothing happened, really, till four or five
years after, when I came home after I’d been out in
the world a bit. Therese had got to be housekeeper,
then. And Father, he said I was to leave her alone.
Well, that of course put me on to her at once. There
were enough of them about I could have got if I’d
cared&mdash;what do you think? Ah, you don’t know
the sort of man Henrik Vang was to look at in those
days! But she was nearest to hand, of course. Ever
so near.... Oh! And handsome, that she was.
In two layers, as you might say, one outside the other.
Father, he was after us whenever he got a chance.
He offered me his gold watch to leave her alone, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I wasn’t such a fool. I’d have that anyway when he
was gone, and I told him so. But then one day
comes Therese and shows me where he’d been
pinching her&mdash;arms black and blue. Well, I wasn’t
going to stand that, you know, so we got a special
licence, and went off and got married in Fredericia.
Father, he didn’t know about it, of course, and when
he sees us coming up the steps arm in arm, he says:
‘Henrik, do you know I’ve kept that girl ever since
your mother died?’ ‘That’s as may be,’ says I.
‘Anyhow, she’s mine now.’ And then I up and
showed him our wedding ring&mdash;cost me ten <i>kroner</i>,
it did. Then says he: ‘Out you get&mdash;out of my
house. A thousand <i>kroner</i> a year, that’s all you’ll
get. The hotel here I’ll keep, as long as I’ve
strength to lift a glass!’”</p>

<p>The tears flowed down over Vang’s puffy purple
cheeks. Egholm sniffed once or twice in sympathy,
and forgot his own troubles for a moment.</p>

<p>Vang licked a last drop from the neck of the
bottle, and went on:</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Therese had never expected
that&mdash;nor had I. But don’t let’s talk about me.
What <em>was</em> I to expect? Drunken fool, that’s all.
Perhaps it was that made her turn religious. I don’t
know. I never can think things out. It tires me.
Well, she said to me: ‘Look here, you get me a
place at the Postmaster’s or the Stationmaster’s, or
one of those you’re always drinking with.’ Well, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
simply laughed at me. But the religious lot, they
didn’t mind. Only the worst of it was, from the
time she set her thoughts on heaven, it’s been simply
hell for me! Now, how d’you explain that?”</p>

<p>Egholm saw him off, going out to the gate with
him, and at the same moment Hedvig opened the
kitchen door. Yes, the dish was empty. A good
thing they had helped themselves before it went
in.</p>

<p>They lit the lamp, and began making things
ready for the night. There was a jumble of things
in every corner. Empty bottles by the dozen, and
in one place she found a parcel, carefully wrapped in
newspaper, containing the skins and skeleton remains
of smoked herrings. Father, no doubt, thought that
was the easiest way of clearing up after him.</p>

<p>“We’ll sleep in the little room, of course,” said
Hedvig firmly to her mother.</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es,” said her mother quietly. But as
Hedvig began dragging the bedding across, she put
on her sternest face, and said:</p>

<p>“Never you mind where your mother’s to sleep
or not to sleep. You know your Bible, don’t you,
enough to remember about man and wife being
one?”</p>

<p>“Ho!”</p>

<p>“But I’ll be there under the window. Yes, that’s
best.”</p>

<p>“I know what I’d have done if I’d been you,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
said Hedvig firmly. “I wouldn’t have washed that
dish.”</p>

<p>“The one with the poison! Heavens, child&mdash;why,
they might have been ever so ill!”</p>

<p>“<em>They might have died!</em>” Hedvig’s eyes were
almost white to look at as she spoke.</p>

<p>At the same moment Egholm came in again,
and now nothing was heard but the rattle of the
iron bedsteads and flapping of sheets and bedclothes
patted down. They shared for better or worse.
Hedvig was given one iron bedstead in the little
room to herself, but had to be content with a woollen
blanket and her father’s old railway cloak for covering.
Fru Egholm had to spread her mattress on the floor
till they could get the settee screwed together; then
she had a real down coverlet over.</p>

<p>Egholm began undressing without a word. His
wife turned down the lamp&mdash;there were no curtains
to the windows. They heard him drop his waistcoat
over by the coal-scuttle, and his trousers by the
door; then he threw himself on his bed, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm stole into the little room, where
Emanuel’s cradle was set against Hedvig’s bed, lest
the master of the house should be disturbed.</p>

<p>Sleeping soundly, the little angel.</p>

<p>“Hedvig dear, you’ve kept your stockings on,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m warm enough&mdash;just feel here.” She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
found her mother’s hand and drew it down over
some thick woollen stuff, that felt strange to the
fingers.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what is it?”</p>

<p>“Look and see!”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm closed the door and struck a match.
There lay Hedvig, covered over with a curious black
rug with a silver fringe round the edges and a cross
in the centre.</p>

<p>For a moment she was dazed, then, calling up
some distant memory, she exclaimed in horror:</p>

<p>“Heavens, child! Why, it’s the pall they use
for the hearse! Wherever did you get it?”</p>

<p>“It was hanging on the stairs outside,” said
Hedvig, with a grin.</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t. However could you, Hedvig!
That you could ever dare.... Come! We
must put it back at once.”</p>

<p>Hedvig made as if to obey, and drew the thing
down, but the moment her legs were free, she turned
a back-somersault and commenced a wild topsy-turvy
dance in the air, waving her feet about like
a catherine-wheel. Then suddenly she disappeared
again under the pall, showing not so much as the tip
of her nose.</p>

<p>The match went out. Fru Egholm shook her
head anxiously, with a faint smile, and stole out of
the room. Hedvig&mdash;what a child!</p>

<p>All was quiet in the parlour now. Egholm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
apparently asleep. Pray God he might wake in a
better mood!</p>

<p>Anyhow, they had got that fellow Vang out of
the house at last&mdash;and if she could manage it, he
should not be in a hurry to come again. He’d a bad
influence. The way he spoke about his wife&mdash;Egholm
would never have talked like that himself!
A nice sort of fellow, indeed&mdash;and his father owned
a hotel!</p>

<p>Her breast heaved as she undressed and laid her
things neatly on a chair, as her father had taught
her when a child. She listened breathlessly&mdash;was
Egholm asleep?</p>

<p>Should she?... He didn’t deserve it&mdash;but
why think of that now?</p>

<p>Softly she dragged the mattress from under the
window, a little way over the floor, stopped, listened,
and dragged it a little farther. Then she started at a
sound, and felt ashamed, as if she had been a thief
trying to steal her own bed.</p>

<p>Little by little she edged her way along, and
finally crept under the clothes with a sigh of
resignation.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he should find her humble
couch on the floor beside his bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII</h2>


<p class="firstpara">But Egholm was not asleep; only lying quite
still, with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>His trouble was that going to bed only
made him wakeful, however sleepy he might have
been while undressing. It generally took him a
couple of hours to get to sleep, and during that time
his eyes seemed to acquire a power of inward vision.
The experiences of the day lifted their coffin lid and
swarmed out from his brain-cells as terrifying apparitions
in the dark.</p>

<p>True, it might happen at times, as now to-day,
that they also appeared in the daytime, but then he
could ward them off as long as he kept on talking and
talking incessantly.</p>

<p>But at night! They laughed at him in horrid
wise, lifted the wrappings from their skulls, and
blinked at him with empty eye-sockets. He was
<em>theirs</em>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he had developed a certain method
in his madness; they could not take him by surprise
now, as they had done at first.</p>

<p>To-day, he had struck Anna three times in the face&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
light blows either, for he could feel his knuckles
slightly tender still&mdash;well and good, then to-night
the result would be that he found Anna exchanged
for Clara Steen, the child with the deep eyes, the
splendid Clara of youth, the beloved little maiden
in the gold frame.</p>

<p>In a gold frame&mdash;yes, an oval gold frame.</p>

<p>Here again was one of those ridiculous things that
could, given the opportunity and a suitable mood,
make a man laugh himself crooked.</p>

<p>Egholm turned over on the other side, and set
himself to think through the whole affair from the
beginning, how it had started when he had first
gone as a boy to work in Konsul Steen’s business in
Helsingør.</p>

<p>The memory here was sweet as a breath from
gardens of lilac, and was intended solely to form a
nice, crude background of contrast to that which
was to come. Yes, Egholm knew the system of these
things.</p>

<p>He saw himself as a slender, brown-eyed, curly-haired
lad running about upstairs and down in the
big store, hauling at casks and pulling out drawers,
followed everywhere by the sharp eyes of Jespersen,
the assistant.</p>

<p>Now down into the cellar for rum, now to the
warehouse for dried fish, then up to the huge loft
for tobacco. Up there was the place he liked best;
not only were the finest goods kept there, breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
essences of the whole world towards him from cases
of spice, but he loved the view from the slip-door,
out over the Sound and the fortress of Kronborg, and
the red roofs of the town.</p>

<p>From north and south came ships with proudly
upright masts and rigging, heaving to while the
Customs officers went on board. And each of them
utilised the opportunity to lay in provisions. Kasper
Egholm was rowed out to them with heavy boat-loads
of wares, and was soon at home on vessels of
all nations&mdash;Dutch, English, French, and Russian.
He even began to feel himself familiar with the
languages.</p>

<p>It was from here he had first caught sight of
Clara, Konsul Steen’s daughter.</p>

<p>Possibly it was as much for her sake as for anything
else that he loved to throw open the slip-door,
or climb up to a window in the roof.</p>

<p>One little episode he remembered as distinctly as
if it had happened yesterday.</p>

<p>He had been set to counting Swedish nails, a
hundred to each packet, but, seeing his chance, used
the scales instead. It was ever so much easier to
weigh them out, than with all that everlasting
counting; also, he could finish in no time, and be
free to loiter by the window and dream.</p>

<p>The wind blows freshly about his ears, he looks
over toward the grey-green slopes of the Swedish
coast, and feels himself as free as if his glance could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
carry him over the Sound, high over the roofs, and
green trees, and the top-masts of the ships.</p>

<p>Suddenly he cranes his neck forward, and a flood
of warmth surges from his heart to his cheeks, swelling
the veins of his neck; <em>there</em>, on the gravel path
just below, in his master’s garden, walks Clara.</p>

<p>White stockings and little low shoes; her footsteps
shoot forward like the narrow-leaved bine of
some swiftly growing plant, and she hums in time
to her walk. Kasper is so fascinated that involuntarily
he hums as well, but wakes with a start of
fright at hearing his own rough voice. He fancies
he can see the delicate skin of her neck gleaming
through the lace edge of her dress, the blue pulse
in her temples, and the play of the sunlight in her
dark-brown hair.</p>

<p>She walks round the lawn, and turns into a patch
that would take her along under the wall, where
Kasper cannot follow. He realises this, and works
his way right out on to the roof, with only his legs
dangling down inside.</p>

<p>“Clara, dear little Jomfru Clara,” whispers his
mouth, “do not go away!”</p>

<p>At the same moment his legs are gripped by
powerful claws, and he is hauled down with such
force and suddenness that he has not time even to
put out his hands. Down he comes anyhow on the
floor, and lies there, bruised and shaken, looking up
into Jespersen’s green eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ho! So you loaf about looking out of the
window when you ought to be counting nails!”</p>

<p>And now it was discovered that he had used the
scales. Jespersen found one packet with ninety-eight
nails and another with a hundred and one
instead of a hundred, and ran off to tell his master.
Next day Kasper was sent for from the inner office.</p>

<p>The thought of this is a culmination of delight
for Egholm in his sleepless state, but at the same
time, he notes, in parenthesis, as it were, that he
is now on the brink of the abyss he <em>knows</em> will shortly
swallow him up.</p>

<p>The stately man with the dark, full beard talks
to him of doing one’s duty to the utmost, not
merely as far as may be seen. And during the
speech Kasper discovers on the leather-covered wall
a picture in a gilded oval frame&mdash;a painting of Clara.</p>

<p>To him it seems even more lovely, even more
living, than the girl herself; his eyes are simply held
spellbound to the beautiful vision.</p>

<p>Konsul Steen glances absently in the same direction,
and then, with a very eloquent gesture, places
himself between Kasper and his daughter.</p>

<p>“Have you already forgotten your duties in life,
which your parents, honest people, I have no doubt,
taught you? What did you say your father was?”</p>

<p>“I’m a foundling,” says the boy, with dignity,
enjoying his master’s embarrassment.</p>

<p>Afterwards, standing out in the passage, he remembers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
only that one question and answer. But,
most of all, Clara’s portrait is burned deep into his
brain. Many a time he steals a peep at it through
the keyhole. Even in the golden days when Clara’s
living self would place her hand in his and follow
him adventuring through the gloomy cellars, or over
mountains of sacks to the topmost opening of the
loft, telling him her troubles and her joys, and
listening to all <em>his</em> confessions, with her firm, commanding,
and yet so innocent eyes fixed on his&mdash;even
then the painting did not lose its halo. And throughout
the many years of struggle, it lived on in his joy
and his anguish, mostly in anguish, it is true, for
there was certainly nothing merely amusing when
it rose up like life before his mental vision, in all its
smiling, merciless beauty, rendering his agony tenfold
worse. Egholm had spoken to several people
about that same thing, among them the doctor at
the hospital where he had once been a patient for
some time. The doctor knew that sort of thing
very well; it was what was called an <em>obsession</em>. Well
and good&mdash;but was that any explanation, after all?
No; it was rather something mysterious, something
of the nature of magic, that had come into his life
from the time he married Anna.</p>

<p>Anna&mdash;yes....</p>

<p>He writhed and twisted in his bed, as if he
were on a spit. His heart pumped audibly and
irregularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>To begin with, she had opened the door, letting
out all the warmth, and made him nervous with all
the things she strewed about the floor.</p>

<p>Then there had been that trouble about the
dark-room, which had driven him out of his senses
with its insistence.</p>

<p>Why couldn’t she understand that it was not
her his blows were aimed at, but at Fate?</p>

<p>What was a photographer without a dark-room?</p>

<p>No&mdash;she could not understand. Not an atom.
She could only stand there and say “But,
Egholm....” and plague him about her kitchen.</p>

<p>Egholm half raised himself in bed, utterly in the
power of his nightmare thoughts, and struck wildly
at the air with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>The vision&mdash;yes, there it was!</p>

<p>“<i>Herregud!</i>&mdash;can’t a man be left to sleep in
peace?” he murmured offendedly, yet with a sort of
humility at the same time. “I’m so tired....”</p>

<p>But as in the gleam of lightning he saw again
and again Jomfru Clara, and at last she stood there
clearly, steadfastly, with her great deep and mischievous
eyes radiantly upon him.</p>

<p>He groaned and shuddered, flinging himself
desperately about as he lay, for he knew what was
coming now.</p>

<p>Hastily, mechanically, he ran through the scene
once more. There stood Anna, and there he himself....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Egholm....”</p>

<p>“You are the serpent....”</p>

<p>His fist shot out into the dark, and struck, this
time, not Anna, but the pale, bright girl who seemed
to glide into her place.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;oh!” He writhed and groaned again,
drawing in his breath between closed lips, as one who
has suddenly cut a deep wound in his hand.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you well, dear?” It was Anna’s voice,
close at hand.</p>

<p>He lay stiff and still, hardly breathing now. The
interruption had driven the horrors away.</p>

<p>Ridiculous&mdash;but so it was with him. He remembered,
for instance, having been haunted by a snake&mdash;one
he had seen preserved in spirits at some railway
station office or other ... yes. That had
stopped, after a while, of itself. But it was worse
with Clara’s picture. In a way, it was more beautiful,
of course&mdash;oh, so beautiful....</p>

<p>He yawned audibly.</p>

<p>But he thought many other things out yet: of his
business and his money affairs; of Vang and Vang’s
domestic life; of an invention he wanted to get on
with&mdash;a thing of almost world-revolutionary importance,
a steam turbine, that could go forward or
back like lightning. It would make him a rich man&mdash;a
wealthy man....</p>

<p>A little later he dropped off to sleep, lying on
his back, and breathing still in little unsteady gasps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Fru Egholm’s straw mattress creaked as she rose
quietly, and with a gentle touch here and there
tucked his bedclothes close about him.</p>

<p>In the next room Hedvig was talking in her
sleep&mdash;something about cakes....</p>

<p>“<i>Herregud!</i>” murmured her mother&mdash;“dreaming
of cakes means illness. I hope it doesn’t mean
Emanuel’s going to get the chickenpox.”</p>

<p>With a sigh she fell off to sleep.</p>

<p>The clock struck two.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIII</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Madam Hermansen came into every
house in Knarreby, without exception&mdash;whence
follows, that she came to Egholm’s.</p>

<p>How she managed to effect an entry there, where
shutters and bolts were carefully set to hide the
shame of poverty, is not stated.</p>

<p>Presumably, she came of herself, like most
diseases&mdash;and she came again and again, like a series
of bad relapses. She literally clung to the Egholms,
and almost neglected her other visits therefor.</p>

<p>They were somehow more remarkable than
others, she thought. They had a past.</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen herself was tolerated&mdash;almost,
one might say, esteemed. At any rate, no attempt
was ever made to find a cure for her. Egholm
enjoyed the abundant laughter with which she greeted
even the most diluted sample of his wit, and Fru
Egholm needed someone to <em>confide in</em>.</p>

<p>It was all very well for <em>him</em>. In his all too extensive
leisure, he made excursions through the
town, spending hours in talk with fishermen down
at the harbour, or going off for solitary walks along
the shore or in the woods. <em>She</em>, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
could only trip about in the two small rooms, with
never a sight of the sun beyond the narrow strip that
drew like the hand of a clock across the kitchen floor
from four till half-past seven in the morning. And
no one to talk to but her husband and the children.
Little wonder, then, that the flow of speech so long
held back poured forth in flood when Madam Hermansen
began deftly working at the sluices.</p>

<p>The talk itself was but a detail, that cropped up
before one knew, thought Fru Egholm at times; but
if she had not had someone to look at her needlework,
why, in the long run, it would mean sinking down to
the level of a man.</p>

<p>True, Madam Hermansen was no connoisseur of
art, but a dollymop who never achieved more than
the knitting of stockings herself. On the other
hand, she was ready to prostrate herself in admiration
of even the most trivial piece of embroidery or
crochet-work. There was something in that....</p>

<p>“Why, it almost turns my head only to look
at it,” she declared, fingering the coverlet for the
chest of drawers. It was one afternoon in May, and
the two women were alone in the house with little
Emanuel.</p>

<p>“Oh, you could learn it yourself in five minutes.”
Fru Egholm flushed with pride, and her hands flew
over the work. “No, but you should see a thing
I made just before we left Odense. Fancy crochet.”</p>

<p>“Heaven preserve us! Me! Never to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
dying day! It’s more than I’m ever likely to learn,
I’m sure. What was it you called it?”</p>

<p>“Fancy crochet. And then I lost it&mdash;it was a
cruel shame, really. And such a lovely pattern.”</p>

<p>“Stolen?” cried Fru Hermansen, slapping her
thighs.</p>

<p>“No. I gave it away to a woman that came
up to congratulate when Emanuel was born. She
praised it up, and I saw what she meant, of course.
But here’s another thing you must see.”</p>

<p>She rose, and took out a pin-cushion from a
drawer.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing special about that, of
course....”</p>

<p>But Madam Hermansen declared she had never
seen anything like it. The pale pink silk showing all
glossy through under the crochet cover was simply
luxurious.</p>

<p>“Ah yes! That’s the sort of things a body
would like to have about the house,” she said, turning
it over in her chapped and knotty hands. “And
what do you use a thing like that for, now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine ladies use it for brooches and things.
But it’s mostly meant for a young girl, you know,
to have on a chest of drawers, this way....”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s much the best. Why, it would
be a sin and a shame to stick pins in a thing like
that.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Fru Egholm, flushing, “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
keep it. Yes, do; it’s yours. No, no; do as I say&mdash;and
we’ll speak no more about it.”</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen made a great fuss of protest,
but allowed herself to be persuaded, and thrust it under
her shawl. She held it as if it had been a live lobster.</p>

<p>And Fru Egholm brought out other things.
There was a newspaper holder worked with poppies,
and a cushion embroidered on canvas.</p>

<p>“There’s little pleasure in having them,” she
sighed. “Egholm, he doesn’t value it more than
the dirt under his feet.”</p>

<p>“Ah! It’s just the same with Hermansen, now.
One Sunday afternoon I came home and found him,
as true as I’m here, sitting on the curtains, smoking,
as careless as could be. But your husband&mdash;I thought
he was a model.”</p>

<p>“Egholm doesn’t smoke. If he did, he’d be just
the same. But I can tell you a thing&mdash;just to show
what he thinks about my work. Ah, Madam Hermansen,
take my word for it, there’s many a slight
a woman has to put up with that hurts more than all
your blows.”</p>

<p>“And he’s been on the railway, too....”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t change human nature, after all. It
was these here things from the auction at Gammelhauge,
the mirror and the chest of drawers, and the
big chair over by the window, and that very one
you’re sitting in now. Now, tell me honestly, would
you call them nice to look at?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Madam Hermansen shifted a little under in her
big green shawl.</p>

<p>“They’re a trifle old fashioned to my mind.”
And she sniffed disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Old fashioned and worm eaten and heavy and
clumsy&mdash;you needn’t be afraid to say it. Why, it’s
almost two men’s work to lift a chair like that. And
as for the glass&mdash;why, it makes you look like a chimney-sweep.
The chest of drawers is not so bad; it does
hold a good deal. Wools and odds and ends....
But, all the same....”</p>

<p>“My daughter she had one with nickel handles
to pull out,” said Madam Hermansen, poking at it.
“And walnut’s the nicest you can have, so the joiner
man said.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I say. But what do you think
Egholm said? ‘Rare specimens,’ he said&mdash;‘solid
mahogany!’ Ugh! Well, do you know what I
did? I set to work then and there and made up
something to cover the worst of it. Those butterflies
for the rocking-chair, and the cloth with the
stars on for the chest of drawers, and paper roses
to put in by the mirror. It took me the whole of a
night, but I wouldn’t have grudged it, if I’d only
got a thimbleful of thanks for my pains. And now,
just listen, and I’ll tell you the thanks I got. One
day the Sanitary Inspector came round to have a
look at the sink. He’d brought a whole crowd with
him&mdash;it was a commission or something, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
mayor and the doctor and the vet, and so on. Then
one of them gets it into his head he’d like to have a
look round the place. Egholm, of course, waves his
hand and says, ‘With pleasure.’ And never a thought
in his head of anything the matter.”</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, they came in through the kitchen and
stood there poking about at the sink for a bit, and
while they’re at it, Egholm comes in here. And
then&mdash;what do you say to this?&mdash;he rushes round
the room and pulls it all off. As true as I’m here;
the butterflies and the paper flowers, and the toilet
cover and all. Threw the flowers under the table,
and stuffed the rest in under his coat. Now, if that
isn’t simply disgraceful....”</p>

<p>“And what did you <em>say</em> to him?” Madam
Hermansen shook herself, giving out a perfume of
leeks and celery from under her shawl.</p>

<p>“Not a word. I had to keep it all back, and
bow and scrape to the gentlemen, with my heart
like to bursting all the time. ‘We must take all
that stuff out of the way when anyone comes,’ he
says after. Oh, he’s that full of his fashionable
notions, there’s no room for human feeling in his
breast. And if there is one thing I can’t abide, it
is that fashionable nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I don’t know that it’s altogether put
on, you know, with him, seeing he’s a man of good
family, as you might say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good family&mdash;h’m. As to that....” Fru
Egholm raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I don’t know, of course,” said Madam
Hermansen, shifting heavily a little forward. “I
thought he was a parson’s son, and his parents were
dead?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed he’s not. Nothing of the
kind.”</p>

<p>“He’s not a circus child, is he?&mdash;there’s some
say he is.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be so surprising, with all his antics
generally. But the real truth is, he’s a foundling&mdash;that
is to say, illegitimate.” Fru Egholm uttered
the last word with a certain coldness, but a moment
after sighed compassionately.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! Well, now, I never did....”
Madam Hermansen sat rocking backwards and forwards
in ecstasy, and as she realised what a grand
piece of news she had got hold of, a silent laughter
began bubbling up from her heart.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm looked at her in some surprise, and,
uncertain how to take her, bent over the cradle and
busied herself with the child.</p>

<p>“Why, then, Madam Danielsen was right, after
all,” said Madam Hermansen. “But who was his
mother, then?”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, she was a fine lady, and
married a professor after&mdash;and that’s a strange
thing, seeing what a plenty of honest girls there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
about. She must have been a baggage, though, all
the same, to get into trouble like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Madam Hermansen, patting
the hairpins that jostled each other in a knot of hair
about the size of a walnut. “And his father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a scatter-brained fellow. Government
official, they called him, but he was a painter&mdash;an
artist, you know&mdash;besides, and I daresay it was that
was his undoing in the end, when he led the girl
astray.”</p>

<p>“But I thought the doctors at the Foundling
Hospital were under oath not to tell who the parents
were?”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough. But d’you think Egholm
would be put off like that? No, he set to work&mdash;that
is, when he was grown up&mdash;and advertised in
<cite>Berlingske Tidende</cite>, putting it all in, so-and-so, as
if he didn’t know what shame was. And then his
sister&mdash;half-sister, that is, of course&mdash;wrote and came
along of her own accord. Nice enough in her way,
she was, too, but you could see she was one of the
same sort....”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm made a grimace involving numerous
wrinkles of the nose. Madam Hermansen nodded as
one who understood.</p>

<p>“Yes ... she gave herself out for an artist, like
her father had been&mdash;and she was the image of him to
look at, too.”</p>

<p>“But I thought....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that of course, in a way. For they said
she used to go sitting in a public place and painting
pictures with a man stark naked as a model.”</p>

<p>“Heaven preserve us!” gasped Madam Hermansen.
“In all my born days.... Well, she must have
been a nice one.”</p>

<p>“She and Egholm simply slobbered over each
other with their affected ways. She called him her
dear lost brother, and how glad she was to find him
again&mdash;and all that sort of thing. I simply said
there was no need to carry on too much about it that
I could see, for if they had grown up together, like
as not they’d have been tearing each other’s eyes out.
He was a terrible child, I believe&mdash;used to pour sand
over the cake-man’s basket outside Rundetaarn, and
let off fireworks in the street and so on.”</p>

<p>“And his father wouldn’t acknowledge him,
then?”</p>

<p>“No. That is to say, his father made haste and
died when the boy was only four or five about, but
he’d had the grace to set aside a little money beforehand,
so Egholm could have the most expensive
schooling there ever was. And it’s left its pretty
mark on him, as you can hear when he speaks.”</p>

<p>“Well, in the way of politeness, as you might say,
he certainly is,” said Fru Hermansen warmly.</p>

<p>“Puh! When there’s anyone about, yes,” said
Fru Egholm. She was not in the humour for praising
her husband just now. “But what’s he like at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
home? Ah&mdash;that’s where you get to know people’s
hearts!”</p>

<p>And before she knew it, she had lifted the roof
off their entire abode, making plain to her visitor
that which had formerly been shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>It was not a little.</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen was simply speechless when
Fru Egholm showed her, with tears, the scars under
her eyes and the little spot by the temple where
the hair was gone.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand you staying another day,”
she said, when the sufferer stuck fast in a sob.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t talk like that. When you’ve
vowed before the altar....”</p>

<p>“Did <em>he</em> vow before the altar to knock you
about like that, eh? Did he say anything about
that?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;o.” Fru Egholm laughed through her
tears, anxious to bring her visitor to a gentler frame
of mind. “No, and it would be no more than his
deserts if I said I wouldn’t live with him any more.
But I can’t help it; it’s not in my nature to do it.
And, after all, it’s his business how he treats his wife,
isn’t it? What’s it to do with me? I couldn’t
think of living anywhere but where he is. Love’s
not a thing you can pull up by the roots all of a
sudden.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘When first the flame of love warms human heart, they little know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What harm they do beyond repair who make it cease to glow!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>“Hymns!” said Madam Hermansen scornfully.</p>

<p>“Ah, but it’s just hymns and such that lift us up
nearer to God.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God’s all right, of course, but it doesn’t
do in this world to leave too much to God.”</p>

<p>“It’s all we poor sinful mortals have. Where do
you suppose I should ever find comfort and solace
if I hadn’t God to turn to? Why, He’s almighty.
He’s even done things with Egholm at times. When
I think of it, I feel ashamed of myself that I ever can
sit and complain. Now, just by way of example....
It was the day we came over here from Odense, me
and the children. I’d no sooner got out of the train
than he puts his arms round me and kisses me right
on the cheek. And what’s the most marvellous
thing about it all&mdash;I can’t understand it to this day&mdash;he
did it right in front of three or four girls standing
staring at us all the time. Ah, Madam Hermansen,
take my word for it, a little thing like that gives you
strength to live on for a long time after. And then
Egholm’s been good to me in other ways. He knows&mdash;Lord
forgive me that I should say it&mdash;that I’m
more of a God-fearing sort than he is himself. And&mdash;I
don’t know how to put it&mdash;that my God’s&mdash;well,
more genuine, as you might say, than his. I’ll tell
you how I found that out, Madam Hermansen. You
know it was said the end of the world was to come a
few years back. It was in all the papers, and Egholm,
he took it all in for gospel truth, because he said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
agreed with the signs in the Revelations, you
know....”</p>

<p>“And did it come?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course it didn’t&mdash;or we shouldn’t be
sitting here now, should we? But Egholm, he was
as sure as could be it was going to happen, on the
thirteenth of November, and when it was only the
eighth, he came and told me to make up a bed for
one of us on the floor. We’d always been used to
sleep together in one bed.”</p>

<p>“But what did he want to change for?” asked
Madam Hermansen, with increasing interest.</p>

<p>“Why,” explained Fru Egholm eagerly, “you
see&mdash;he confessed himself why it was; he was wonderfully
gentle those days. He wouldn’t have us sleeping
together&mdash;not because of anything indecent or
that sort, but because it says in the Bible that on the
Day of Judgment there may be two people sleeping
in the same bed, ‘and the one shall be taken and
the other left.’”</p>

<p>“So, you see. Madam Hermansen, I soon reckoned
out what he thought, how I might get to heaven
after all.”</p>

<p>“And he’s never been in love with anybody&mdash;<em>outside</em>,
I mean?”</p>

<p>“There’s one he’s in love with,” laughed Fru
Egholm&mdash;“more than anything else in the world.
And that’s&mdash;himself! No, thank goodness he’s never
had time for that sort of thing, being too busy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
his steam-engine inventions. Now I think of it,
though, there was a girl once, when he was quite
young, over in Helsingør. Clara Steen was her name.
You’ll have heard of Consul Steen, no doubt;
he’s ever so rich. His daughter, it was. And she
ran after him to such a degree.... Why, he used
to write verses to her. Though I don’t count that
anything very much against him, for he’s written
poetry to me, too, in the days when we were
engaged.”</p>

<p>She thrust a practised hand into her workbox,
and fished up a yellowed scrap of paper, and read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Helsingør by waters bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a Venice to the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the world thy fame doth know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beeches fair around thee grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fortress with its crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks majestically down,...’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fru Hermansen relapsed into an envious silence,
absently investigating her nostrils with one finger.
Fru Egholm took out some new hair, and compared
the colour with that she was using.</p>

<p>“Think that will do?” she asked ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, it ought to. It’s a deal prettier than the
other.”</p>

<p>“But it oughtn’t to be! You’re supposed to
have all the same coloured hair in one plait.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! I’ve no patience with all their affected
ways,” said Fru Hermansen sullenly. She was
disappointed at finding the conversation turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
something of so little interest by comparison. “What
was I going to say now?” she went on. “Was it
just lately he knocked you about like that?”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;es, of course. But no worse than before.
Not nearly so bad. And anyhow, if he did, I suppose
it was God’s will. Or else, perhaps, he can’t help it,
by reason of always having an unruly mind.”</p>

<p>She checked herself with a sudden start, and
her busy hands fell to patting aimlessly here and
there.</p>

<p>“I think it must be toothache,” she said in a
loud, drawling, careless voice, altogether different
from her former manner.</p>

<p>“Toothache?...” Madam Hermansen sat
with her mouth wide open for a moment&mdash;then she,
too, caught the sound of Egholm’s approaching step.
“Yes, yes, of course, it would be toothache, yes,
yes....” And she chuckled with a sound like the
rattle of a rake on a watering-can.</p>

<p>“Emanuel, I mean, of course,” said Fru Egholm
confusedly, as her husband walked in. He was
carrying a huge paper bag, that looked as if it might
burst at any minute.</p>

<p>He set it down carefully, and joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Now, if only Anna would let me,” he said eagerly,
“I’d cure that child in no time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard you can do all sorts of wonders, so
people say.” Fru Hermansen leaned back with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
hands folded across her lap, and looked up admiringly
at Egholm.</p>

<p>“Why, I know a trifle of the secrets of Nature,
that’s all. As for toothache, there’s no such thing.
The youngster there&mdash;what’s his name, now?&mdash;Emanuel,
is suffering from indigestion, nothing more.
Give him a plate of carrots chopped up fine, mixed
with equal parts of sand and gravel, morning and
evening, and he’d be all right in a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“Never as long as I live!” said Fru Egholm.</p>

<p>“Powdered glass is very effective, too,” went on
Egholm, encouraged by Fru Hermansen’s laughter,
and putting on a thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>“I’ll not see a child of mine murdered that or
any other way,” said the mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you’d see what a difference it would
make. I’m quite in earnest. Haven’t you heard
that fowls have to have gravel? I noticed it myself
yesterday with my own eyes, saw them pecking it
up. And the idea came to me at once. I’ve half
a mind, really, to set up as a quack doctor....”</p>

<p>Egholm was interrupted by a sudden splash
behind him. The paper bag he had placed on the
chest of drawers, dissolved by the moisture of something
within, had burst; a lump of squashy-looking
semi-transparent stuff had slipped to the floor, and
more threatened to follow.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm, sorrowful and indignant, hurried
to save her embroidered slip from further damage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t go spoiling my jelly-fish! Better bring
a plate, or a dish or something.”</p>

<p>“What on earth are they for, now?” asked Madam
Hermansen.</p>

<p>“That’s a great secret. For the present, at any
rate. Well, I don’t know; I may as well tell you,
perhaps. These ... are jelly-fish&mdash;Medusæ.” He
tipped the contents out into a washing-basin, and
poked about among the quivering specimens. “Look,
here’s a red one&mdash;the sort they call stingers. If
you touch one, it stings you like nettles. The others
are harmless&mdash;just touch one and try. Smooth and
luscious, like soapsuds, what?”</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen advanced one hand hesitatingly,
but drew it back with a scream.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” said Egholm, undismayed. “Well,
now, what do you think they’re for? Shall I tell
you? Why, <em>soap!</em> There’s only one thing lacking
to make them into perfect soap&mdash;a touch of lime to
get a grip on the dirt&mdash;and perhaps a trifle of scent.
And, only think, they’re lying about on the beach in
thousands, all to no use. Yes ... I’ll start a soap
factory, that’s what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said you were going to be a
doctor,” said Fru Egholm, with an innocent expression,
winking at Madam Hermansen.</p>

<p>“Both. And then we can save on the advertising.
‘Egholm’s United Surgeries and Soap
Factories.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“And one as bad as the other.” Anna had to
shout aloud to make herself heard through the tempest
of Madam Hermansen’s laughter.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, one as good as the other. Oh, I
shall be famous all over Denmark, all over Europe.
We’ll have an advertisement for the doctoring on all
the soap wrappers: speciality&mdash;broken legs!”</p>

<p>“If only you don’t break your neck holding your
head in the air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t thinking of bones,” said Egholm,
delighted with the effect he was producing. “I was
referring to the fracture of <em>wooden</em> legs.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I wonder if you could set this to
rights for me?” said Fru Hermansen, patting her calf.</p>

<p>“Easily! What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that it’s proper for me to
show you, but never mind. We’re both married
folk. This leg of mine’s been bad for&mdash;let me see&mdash;fifteen
or sixteen years it is now. And Dr. Hoff, he’s
no idea, the way he’s messed about with it.”</p>

<p>Fru Hermansen turned round, set her foot upon
a chair, and busied herself with underclothing, tying
and untying here and there, and muttering to herself
the while.</p>

<p>“There, you have a look at it,” she said at last,
with a laugh, and faced round again.</p>

<p>She had a rag in her mouth, and her face was
flushed from bending down. Her skirts were lifted
to her knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>From the ankle up over the shin, almost to the
kneecap, was a long red sore, yellowish in the centre.
It looked horribly like a trail of some climbing plant.</p>

<p>Egholm put out a hand as if to ward off the sight,
and looked away. But the would-be patient said
harshly:</p>

<p>“And you going to be a doctor! If you can’t
abide the smell of hot bread, then it’s no good going
for a baker!”</p>

<p>Egholm overcame his reluctance, knelt down, and
began examining the leg, from the greenish-faded
stocking that was gathered like an ankle-ring at the
bottom, to the knee, where a garter had cut deep
brownish-red furrows.</p>

<p>“Here’s the mischief,” he said, nodding wisely.
“The blood can’t get past here, and that’s why it
can’t heal. You’ll have to stop wearing garters at
once.”</p>

<p>“Easy to hear it’s a man that’s talking,” laughed
Fru Egholm.</p>

<p>“And then we must draw fresh blood to the
spot. Let me see....”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d have seen enough by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Fresh blood....” he murmured. His mind
was busy choosing and rejecting from a hundred
different things; nothing seemed to satisfy him
quite. A smile of irony at his own idea curved his
lips; it was not such a simple matter, after all, to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to work with Egholm’s United Soap Factories and
Surgeries, specialising in leg troubles.</p>

<p>Suddenly his face brightened all over.</p>

<p>“Those jelly-fish&mdash;what did you do with the
dish?”</p>

<p>“But, Egholm? what do you want them for
now?”</p>

<p>“You leave that to me. We want something to
tickle up the nerves, and draw the blood to the
spot.”</p>

<p>He picked up the “stinger”&mdash;in his coat-tails&mdash;and
held it out. It was domed like a dish-cover, and
ornamented with a fiery double star at the top;
innumerable threads of slimy stuff hung from its
lower side.</p>

<p>“Suppose we put that on the sore?”</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen, in her first amazement, had
hoisted her canvas beyond all reasonable limits;
now, she let all down with a run.</p>

<p>“None of your games with me, thank you,” she
said sharply.</p>

<p>“What?” said Egholm in surprise. “You
won’t? I warrant you the leg will be all in a glow
in no time. And then it’s a practically certain cure.”</p>

<p>He waved the thing enticingly before her, exhibiting
it from all sides, and bending it to show the
venomous lips. “Why, I wouldn’t mind putting it
on myself.”</p>

<p>But Madam Hermansen’s face was dark and discouraging;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
she set about resolutely wrapping her
tender spot in all its armour of rags and bandages.</p>

<p>“And quite right of you, I’m sure, Madam
Hermansen,” said Fru Egholm.</p>

<p>“Well, well, we must hit on something else,”
said Egholm. “I won’t give it up. But it must be
a natural cure in any case. The sources of Nature
are manifold.”</p>

<p>And by way of restoring good humour all round,
he began telling the story of the furniture from
Gammelhauge.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that an elegant chair I’ve got there? Do
for a throne; look at the coronet on the back&mdash;it’s
almost on my own head now as I sit here. I’ve just
the feel of an old nobleman, a general, or a landed
aristocrat, in this chair. Let’s bring it up in front
of the glass. What’s the use of sitting on a throne
with a coronet on your bald pate when you can’t see
yourself?”</p>

<p>“Now I suppose you’ll be putting a new glass
in the mirror&mdash;another twenty&mdash;thirty&mdash;forty&mdash;fifty
<i>kroner</i> gone, but that’s nothing, of course,” cried
Madam Hermansen.</p>

<p>“Not in the least, my dear lady. In <em>this glass</em> it
was that the splendidly attired knights and ladies
surveyed their magnificence before the feasting
commenced.”</p>

<p>It could be seen from Egholm’s movements how
a knight and his lady were wont to prance and preen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
themselves before a mirror. A little after, he added
in a voice of mystery:</p>

<p>“I have often seen shadows moving by in there,
of an evening.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! The nasty thing! I wouldn’t have it in
my house for anything,” said Madam Hermansen,
with a shiver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIV</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Egholm took his washing-basin across to the
studio, which had been fitted up at one end
of the carpenter’s store shed. The jelly-fish
he placed for the present as far in under the table
as possible.</p>

<p>First of all, he must get some work done. There
were Sunday’s negatives to develop&mdash;he could be
thinking a bit while he was doing that. Egholm
found the new dark-room an excellent place for
thought, free from all disturbance.</p>

<p>Yes, he would think over that turbine.</p>

<p>That jelly-fish soap business was merely an idea&mdash;quite
possibly, indeed probably, a good idea. But
the turbine, the <em>reversible steam-turbine</em>, was the
child of his heart, born of him, conceived by him
in a length of sleep-forsaken nights. Once brought
forth to the world, it would be greeted with acclamation.</p>

<p>It was imminent, it was hovering in the air, this
question of something to replace the more complicated
steam-engine. The English had come very
near to a solution already.</p>

<p>But, for all that, it might perhaps be reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
himself, for Egholm the Dane, to show them how to
make their turbine reverse.</p>

<p>He could think of more than one thing at
a time. As long as he could cast out sufficient
ballast, he could always find a new direction of
the wind to carry his thought. Nearest earth
was the current connected with his work, but even
that was no less erratic than those of the higher
strata.</p>

<p>Might as well try the new developer to-day, he
thought to himself, and set out his dishes all ready.
Then he went into the studio again, and began studying
the recipes he had scrawled up from time to time
on the plank wall of the dark-room. Already there
were so many of them that the list reached to the
floor. He had to go down on his knees to see if it
said 25 gr. or 35 gr. Suddenly he forgot what he
was there for, and remained lying prone, thinking
only of his steam-turbine; it seemed to him the
axle bearings ought to be made with a little more
stability yet. The slightest oscillation, of course,
would mean an escape of steam&mdash;waste of power.
Then, becoming aware of his posture, he wondered
how he had got there, but, finding himself on his
knees, he at once, as a practical man, decided to
utilise the opportunity, and started off on a long
and earnest prayer to God for the furtherance of
his idea. It was, indeed, not merely a point of
honour with him that it should succeed, but also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
he might as well confess, a hoped-for way out of his
present difficulties.</p>

<p>The photography business had turned out a
desperate failure&mdash;there was no denying it.</p>

<p>The only people who came at all were the peasants
who came into town on Sundays. Of these, quite
a good number patronised the studio, but, unfortunately,
they did not always come for the photos
they had ordered. They were not impressed by his
skill when they found the studio situate in a woodshed
at the back of Andreasen’s, with the camera
perched on a cement barrel instead of a tripod.</p>

<p>The fine folk of the place, in accordance with an
established tradition, always went over to the neighbouring
town for their photographs. It didn’t seem
to count, somehow, unless they did.</p>

<p>They were just as superficial in their judgment
as the peasants, and paid more heed to a smart shop
than to the artistic execution of the pictures.</p>

<p>Here Egholm laughed to himself. The photographs
he turned out could hardly be included under
the heading of art at all, and he knew it. But was
there anything surprising in that? In the first
place, how could anyone help becoming dulled by
so much adversity, and in the second&mdash;oh, well, in
the second place, why the devil should <em>he</em> put himself
out for all and sundry, when it was only a question
of time before he threw aside his mask and revealed
himself as a world-renowned inventor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Smilingly he set to rocking his plates in their
bath, and as the work went on, he bored out, in his
mind, the steam channels of his turbine, and decided
on the cogwheel transference.</p>

<p>He held a negative up to the light, and recognised
three of his customers grouped about the
little round table. Yes, it was those three that had
taken such particular care to have the labels on
their beer bottles facing neatly front, towards the
observer.</p>

<p>Ho, ho! And that was the sort one had to bow
and scrape to!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this business of the turbine was
not a matter to be settled in a moment. Rothe,
the ironfounder, had promised to make him the
larger parts, and Krogh, the smith, who had at first
answered gruffly and bent farther over his intricate
lock work, had been completely won over as an
adherent. The next thing was to procure a boat
into which the turbine could be built.</p>

<p>Now, where on earth could he get a boat for no
money at all? Well, never mind; imagine the boat
was there. Then the upright boiler would have to
be set in <em>there</em>, a trifle aft of midships, so that the
man at the helm could stoke as well. As for the
screw, that would require special treatment in these
waters, where there was so much weed about. He
would have to go into that.</p>

<p>Egholm’s mind was so keen that he saw every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
detail. Difficulties were disposed of as fast as they
appeared.</p>

<p>Not till the last of the plates glided into the
fixing solution did he come to himself, and then to
find his heart pumping like the steam-turbine at full
speed. It was always like that when he had been
long at work in the dark-room. He threw open the
door and went out, but the light and the fresh air
turned him dizzy and blind for the moment; he
staggered to a bench, and had to sit there some time
before he recovered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<h2>XV</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Hedvig knew how to make herself respected.
She and her father glared at each other with
eyes alert and claws ready, but it was rarely
anything more came of it. She had a place at the
baker’s, running errands for six <i>kroner</i> a month, which
was no small sum for a girl still at school. Anyhow,
it was practically half their rent.</p>

<p>Yet she was a strange little creature, not like other
children, and her confidence slipped somehow between
her mother’s fingers.</p>

<p>Many a night the keyhole of the door to her little
room still showed a speck of light by the time the
clock struck twelve, or even one. Her mother lay
anxiously listening to Egholm’s snore; there was no
saying what terrible thing might happen if he were to
wake and find it out. But Hedvig would listen to
reproaches the next morning with an unfathomable
expression on her face, or smile, and shake her head.
The pocket of her dress bulged with a new novel
every other day.</p>

<p>“You should tell your mother what it <em>says</em> in
those silly books you’re always reading,” said Fru
Egholm admonishingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you’d never understand a word of it,”
was all Hedvig answered.</p>

<p>One day she had stuck up a picture over her bed,
showing a man and a woman, tied together with a
rope, flinging themselves into the water from a
bridge. A yellow half-moon shone through the
tree-tops and was reflected in the water. Hedvig
stood quietly, apparently indifferent, as her mother
tore it down and told in vehement words how sinful
it was to look at such things. But when her mother
moved to hold it over the lamp, the girl flung herself
suddenly in front of her with wild screams, and
would not be brought to her senses until she had the
horrible picture safely put away in her workbox.</p>

<p>Now, who would ever believe that this was the
same good little Hedvig that the baker’s people
always said a good word for, and who could always
manage to find a way when it was a case of helping
others! Fuel, for instance&mdash;Egholm did not seem
to have the instinct of acquiring fuel. But Hedvig
was a little marvel in that way&mdash;though, no doubt, it
was largely through the help of Marinus in the workshop,
to give him his due. He always tucked away
odd bits under his work-bench for her. He was a
kindly sort, was Marinus. And he seemed particularly
fond of Hedvig, and she of him&mdash;that is to
say, at times. For it was towards Marinus that her
fickleness of humour showed itself most of all. Sometimes
when she had been in the workshop she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
come back and fall into a fit of miserable weeping;
at other times she would rush in at once the moment
he tapped with his rule on the pane, whether she
wanted firewood for the kitchen or no. And as to
getting any explanation out of her&mdash;that, of course,
was hopeless.</p>

<p>Otherwise, she was particularly good at telling
things, and both her father and her mother were
often amused at her way of relating little things that
had passed.</p>

<p>Her father even had a speciality of his own in
this respect; he loved to hear of the money Hedvig
took across the counter when she was minding shop
while her mistress was at dinner.</p>

<p>Then it would be Wassermann, the Customs
officer, who came in and bought best part of a tray of
mixed pastries&mdash;he was such a sweet tooth. Then
perhaps there would be a message from Etatsraadens’
for sixty butter puffs for to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>“Sixty!” cried her father. “And what do they
cost apiece?”</p>

<p>“Three <i>øre</i>&mdash;but, Lord! that’s nothing to them
at all. No, you should have seen the order that came
in the day they had their garden party. <em>Five</em> cakes
with icing and marzipan.”</p>

<p>“Why, the bakers must be making a fortune.”</p>

<p>“They’ve made it already. Mistress bought a
new hat the other day.”</p>

<p>“What was on it?” asked her mother. But her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
father leaned back with closed eyes, feeling as if his
own thirst were assuaged for the moment by the flow
of money Hedvig dipped her fingers in.</p>

<p>He was feverish, and needed something cooling.
Here he was in the throes of his invention, and could
not get it out.</p>

<p>Not a step nearer. No boat, nothing. And it
was nearly autumn now. The trees stood there with
their round juicy fruits. But, in his mind, it was all
flowers. Was there anyone in all Knarreby so poor
as the Egholms? Unless it were Bisserup, the brushmaker.
And yet Egholm had spared no pains. He
had tried Etatsraaden, tried Bro, the grocer, Rothe,
the ironfounder; practically speaking, everyone of
means in the place. He had also, by the way, tried
those without means. Altogether, he had not
passed by many an open ear without shouting into
it something about Egholm’s fore-and-aft turbine.
Rothe had promised to make the castings for him, but
that was all.</p>

<p>He looked at Hedvig. She stood up, reaching
with her thin, girlish arms for the parcel with her
white apron in, up on the dresser. Off to her work.
Off to all that money again.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” he said. There was a slight
pause then, before he could stammer out his proposal&mdash;that
they should all kneel down and pray to
God. He did not know why, but it must be now,
just at this moment, he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>This was by no means a new and unheard-of
thing; on the contrary, it had been known as far
back as Hedvig could remember.</p>

<p>“It’ll keep till this evening, won’t it?” she said.
“I shall be late if I stay behind now.”</p>

<p>“‘Seek first the kingdom of God and righteousness....’”</p>

<p>“Ha!” A single sound, like the scream of a
cockerel, escaped from Hedvig. It was the first
time she had openly derided her father’s godliness.
She regretted it bitterly next moment. True, the
door out to the alley-way was open, just at her left,
but what was the good of escaping herself when her
mother was left behind to face what would come?
She knew what it was to come home in high spirits
from her work, and find her mother weeping, perhaps
bruised into the bargain. She had no wish to experience
that again.</p>

<p>The tears were gathering already; something was
choking her.</p>

<p>Egholm set his hands on the arms of his chair,
to spring up and dash out into the kitchen, but his
anger seemed to snap in the middle.</p>

<p>In a sudden glimpse of vision he saw Hedvig in a
new light. The slip of a girl, whose naughtinesses
he had been at such pains to weed out, was no longer
a slip of a girl and merely naughty&mdash;she was a
<em>sinner</em>.</p>

<p>Every line of her figure, every feature in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
face spoke blasphemy. She stood there with the
challenge of an idol.</p>

<p>With a strangely sweet horror her father noted
all: her guilty mouth, half-open, with lips pale
and narrow, yet fresh, and teeth white as almonds,
whence issued that hell-born defiance. Her blood
must be evil as smoking brimstone.</p>

<p>Egholm sank back powerless in his chair.</p>

<p>But a moment later a new feeling came over
him. How great a thing would it be to bring this
child of sin to God, with bowed head and folded
hands. “There is more joy in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth, than of the ninety and nine
which need no repentance.” So the Scripture said.
Hedvig would be a heavenly subject for conversion.</p>

<p>And there could be no doubt but that God would
appreciate the efforts of the one who had borne the
trial of that conversion.</p>

<p>Hedvig stood with her back to him, slightly
stooping, as if awaiting the blow. She started when
her father came out and laid his hand on her shoulder
instead.</p>

<p>The conversion process appeared strangely easy;
yes, she should always find something to say to the
bakers by way of excuse. She set to work at once
pulling the chairs aside to make room.</p>

<p>Her father looked crestfallen and unsatisfied.
He had been prepared for a struggle&mdash;but this was
<em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, he had something in reserve. Little
Emanuel, whose inconsiderable length of days might
serve as warrant for his innocence, was set on a
pillow in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>“Put something under your knees, Hedvig dear,”
said her mother.</p>

<p>“No need of that,” said Egholm, thumping his
own on the floor with unnecessary force.</p>

<p>“Oh, great and merciful God....”</p>

<p>“You’ve got your hat on, dear,” said Fru Egholm
mildly.</p>

<p>He sent her a wrathful glance, but laid aside
his hat with much dignity.</p>

<p>“Almighty God, Lord of Heaven and Earth....”</p>

<p>Egholm’s prayer began as a sonorous commonplace,
an echo from the halls of the Brethren of St.
John. But gradually, as his subject grew on him,
his own individual religious view for the time being
showed through.</p>

<p>It was to God as the Owner of great possessions
that he prayed.</p>

<p>If any had asked him who was the greatest inventor
in the world, he would have confessed, with
a pious bend of the head, that it was one of the
least of God’s servants, an unworthy creature by
the name of Egholm. But at the thought that
God <em>owned</em> the fields, the woods, and the cities&mdash;the
lands and the seas, Egholm, who had never owned
more than the poor clothes he wore and a trifle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
old furniture, was moved to prostrate himself before
that mighty power.</p>

<p>It distressed him, however, that God should
suffer those possessions of His to be put to ill use,
in that He allowed them to fall into the wrong
hands. It was by no means altogether selfishness
that led him, Egholm, here to point out himself as
one who would be a true and grateful steward of
even the largest and most troublesome estate.</p>

<p>“Am I not Thy son, art Thou not my Father,
whose will it is that all should be well with me?”</p>

<p>Hedvig heard but little of her father’s words:
her eyes were following the hands of the clock; it
was jerking by tiny stages on towards twelve. There
it stopped, and seemed to linger for a moment, as if
inviting the figure to join it on its way; then on
again, irrevocably on and on. She clenched her
teeth in impotent fury. Then suddenly a new note
was touched in her father’s prayer&mdash;something which
made her all attention.</p>

<p>He had commenced, quite advisedly, with the
practical human tactics of praising those qualities
in the Lord which he himself wished to call forth
towards himself.</p>

<p>“Thy goodness is without end and beyond all
measure. So great is Thy love to us poor children
of men, that Thou hearest every prayer we offer
up to Thee, and grantest it. It is written: ‘Ask,
and thou shalt receive!’ So great is Thy loving-kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
unto us, that Thou wouldst not have us
suffer more, and therefore sayest, let there be an
end. Behold, Egholm Thy servant groaneth under
the weight of poverty; Thou seest, and it is enough;
Thou sayest the word, and lo, Thy servant cometh
into riches and happiness....”</p>

<p>The words seemed to have a sort of hypnotic
power; for a moment, Hedvig quivered with hope
that it might really come to pass. Then she remembered
how often she had heard the same thing;
how many times she had been forced to kneel thus
on aching knees in prayer for the same, but to no
avail. From the time she was first able to speak,
her tongue had praised the Lord. Now, it revolted
her; something within her seemed to rise in protest;
she felt that she <em>hated</em> God.</p>

<p>Never for a moment did she doubt His existence;
on the contrary, she seemed to see His face. But it
was a face hard and cold as stone, with eyes looking
absently out. The ardent prayers of men were
powerless to affect Him.</p>

<p>She began mumbling an oath every time her
father found a new form for his praise.</p>

<p>It was otherwise with Egholm himself. He felt
stronger and stronger as he went on; and at sight of
Hedvig’s lips moving, he burst into tears, and found
courage to speak out without reserve.</p>

<p>For it was a curious fact that more courage was
needed to ask for little things. It was a simple matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
enough to pray for wealth and happiness in general,
but to-day he managed to get out the matter that
really troubled him.</p>

<p>“Dear, good Lord, grant me&mdash;or only <em>lend</em> me&mdash;one
hundred <i>kroner</i>; even fifty would do. You know
what it’s for&mdash;that boat, the green boat of Ulrik’s.
Not his new one, but the old. You know, dear Lord,
I want it for my steam-turbine. And I’ve come to
a dead stop now, and can’t move a step if you won’t
lend me a miserable fifty <i>kroner</i>....”</p>

<p>His voice had altered now to a wheedling tone,
with a marked city accent. He made a sort of half
scrape-and-bow, and finished off.</p>

<p>“A&mdash;far....” prattled Emanuel.</p>

<p>It was Egholm’s habit after a prayer to embrace
his wife. He made as if to do so now, but, to his
surprise, she thrust him away with every indication
of ill-will.</p>

<p>“No! Don’t think you’re going to get me on
to that sort of thing, because I won’t.”</p>

<p>“That sort of thing!” Egholm’s voice was uncertain;
he had a feeling that his wife was, after all,
somehow in relation with the heavenly powers.</p>

<p>“No good having a cow that yields when it kicks
over the bucket after. The first part was all right,
but if you think God’s going to help with your silly
tricks about that turbine thing&mdash;why, you’re very
much mistaken.”</p>

<p>“But, why not?...”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because it’s an abomination. Cain was the
first smith, and you know it. And the Lord hates
all that hammering and smithying about at turbines
and steam carts and friction cylinders....”</p>

<p>“Friction couplings,” corrected Egholm gently.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care what you call them. He
hates all that sort of stuff, whatever name you give it.
And you can be certain sure you’ll get nothing out
of that prayer,” she concluded, with a lofty shake of
her head.</p>

<p>Egholm sat down in silence, and Hedvig, seeing
that he was overcome by some incomprehensible
means, hurried off in relief.</p>

<p>What had come to Egholm now? Was he
impressed by his wife’s wisdom? Oh, he thought
her foolish beyond words.</p>

<p>But she had destroyed his exaltation as effectively
as a knife thrust into a balloon.</p>

<p>His head dropped on his breast.</p>

<p>Yes, it was true enough, no doubt, that God was
against him in all his plans and inventions. His
prayer had been in vain, despite the brilliant idea of
bringing along Hedvig as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think I ought to do?” he
asked weakly.</p>

<p>“Me! And how’s a simple creature like me to
say what you should do? You’re so clever....”</p>

<p>He fancied there was something behind her words,
and grasped at it eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“What d’you mean?”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm kept up her pretence of emptiness
for some time, but her speech was crafty as a will-o’-the-wisp,
and he followed her till he lost his foothold.
Then she said:</p>

<p>“Write to the Brethren, and ask for your money
back.”</p>

<p>Egholm looked up with a momentary gleam of
light, but pursed up his mouth in a grimace, and
said:</p>

<p>“The Brethren&mdash;no. I’ve done with them for
good and all.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, just as you please,” said she.
And no more was said.</p>

<p>Towards evening, Egholm took his stick, and went
for a walk through the town and down along the
quay.</p>

<p>The black gliding waters of the Belt slapped
softly against the stonework, and patted like flat
hands under the tarred beams. He went right out
to the point, where some boys were fishing with lines,
and calling to one another in their singing dialect,
as often as they fancied a bite.</p>

<p>A big Norwegian timber ship with a heavy deck-load
lay in the harbour, and all the fishing-boats of
Knarreby were gathered along the side of the quay.</p>

<p>The background was dominated by the church,
the Custom House, and Vang’s hotel. To the west,
little fisher huts set all up a steep slope, that rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
farther on to the great beeches of Kongeskoven.
Knarreby itself was on an elevation; the ground line
of St. Nicholas Church was level with the roof of
the Custom House. From where he stood, Egholm
could see two gravestones showing white in the
churchyard.</p>

<p>Loud voices could be heard from the terrace of
Vang’s hotel; three gentlemen had just come out,
and were sniffing and wiping their foreheads with
handkerchiefs. Evidently, they had been dining.
Somebody gave an order to a waiter, with a heavy
slap on the back. There was a certain noisiness
apparent.</p>

<p>Egholm pricked up his ears&mdash;that was Rothe’s
voice and no other.</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;and now he recognised the other two: the
warlike editor and Vang with a silk skull-cap.</p>

<p>Here were three men who, he felt sure, never
bowed the knee to God. And yet they seemed to
enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>How could it be?</p>

<p>That fellow Rothe, for instance, the ironfounder.
He was said to have started at the lowest rung, as
a blacksmith’s hand, eighteen years ago. Now, he
owned the whole of Knarreby ironfoundry.</p>

<p>A turbine boat would be a mere nothing to a
man like that.</p>

<p>Egholm sat on the quay for a while, following
the three with envious eyes; then he strolled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
towards the land with the ferrule of his stick dragging
listlessly over the stones.</p>

<p>There was the usual crowd of fishermen gathered
about the warehouse. They were always to be found
there or over by the agent’s house. The walls of
both were worn smooth by the backs of their
trousers.</p>

<p>“Going to have thunder?” asked Egholm, with
a swinging gesture which he fancied smacked of the
sea.</p>

<p>They puffed at their pipes, and squinted in towards
the centre, where Peder Kvabs stood. He was the
fattest and reddest-faced of them all, and went about
in his shirt-sleeves all the year round. When he said
nothing, then there was nothing to be said.</p>

<p>Well, after all, no need for any introduction,
thought Egholm, and came to the matter of his
turbine at once. Funny thing, when you came to
think of it, that in four or five years from now every
little rowing-boat would have its turbine, and go
spurting across the Belt like a cat, dead against the
wind.</p>

<p>“If only it don’t turn out one of them infernal
machines like they use for the Czar,” said Peder
Kvabs, spitting between his teeth. The others were
roused at his words to some considerable emotion.
They rubbed themselves against the wooden wall,
spat, and worked their eyebrows up and down. One
of them made strange sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said Egholm, discomfited, “you wait
and see.”</p>

<p>He walked a few paces, swinging his stick, then
turned and called back to them:</p>

<p>“You wait and see when it comes! I’m getting
the money now&mdash;three or four hundred <i>kroner</i>.
From Odense. It’s money I was done out of under
false pretences. And I’m going to have the law of
them....”</p>

<p>The woollen jerseys seemed to betray a seething
and bubbling within. The men could contain themselves
no longer. Suddenly Peder Kvabs hoisted
his slacks, and led the whole flock hastily into the
nearest <i>café</i>. There was no need to ask should they
go; all felt it was a simple necessity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Egholm to himself. “That’s what
I’ll do. They couldn’t give it against me if I went
to law.”</p>

<p>But he felt sorely in need of someone who would
have faith in him, and he longed for Henrik Vang’s
ever-ready admiration. Might just slip up to his
room....</p>

<p>Fru Vang kept a quiet little boarding-house for
a few old bachelors who had taken the best rooms
of the house. She and Vang himself occupied separate
attics.</p>

<p>Vang was in bed, with half an inch of reddish
stubble on his chin, and the hair on his forehead
clammy with feverish sweat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, what’s this?” cried Egholm, aghast.
“Are you ill? And I’d never heard a word....
A great strong fellow like you! What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Sit down a minute,” said Vang faintly. “We
can shift this here. Or give it to Diana ... there
you are.”</p>

<p>He set a plate down on the floor, and wiped the
seat of a chair with his bare arm.</p>

<p>“I’ve worked it out,” said Egholm, without
preface. “The boiler must be vertical. With the
first experimental boat, of course, it’s more than
ever important to save space. Can’t make out why
I didn’t hit on that before.”</p>

<p>There were half a score of other things he had
“worked out.” Vang listened attentively, wrinkling
up his forehead and gazing ceilingwards, as if something
were passing far above his head.</p>

<p>Egholm felt comfortable now, and in a burst of
geniality exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Here, Vang, you’d better let me have a look at
you. I’m something of a doctor&mdash;natural healer,
you know. I was patching up Madam Hermansen’s
leg the other day. Have you seen a doctor at all?
What did he say?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” said Vang, looking away.</p>

<p>“All the better; nothing to distract my instinctive
powers. Where’s the pain?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know all the time,” said Vang piteously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
laying one hand on Egholm’s arm. “Don’t go teasing
me now, there’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p>Egholm rose to his feet in surprise; his imagination
was weaving intricate tangles in a moment.</p>

<p>“Is it&mdash;is it.... No, I’ve no idea&mdash;really, I
haven’t.”</p>

<p>Vang pouted like a boy, and after a little hesitation
explained that his wife had a habit now and
again&mdash;more and more frequently of late&mdash;of taking
away his trousers. He had been lying here now for
four days, with no trousers to put on.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t sit there grinning just like all the
rest of them!”</p>

<p>“I’m not, indeed. So she takes away your
trousers? First-rate idea, you know, really. She’s
one of my sort. But, look here, you know, we must
be able to borrow a pair from somewhere. I’ve
only these myself, more’s the pity. But we might
take it in turns....”</p>

<p>“There’s only one man in the place whose trousers
fit me. And he won’t. Oh, the beast! I sent
down to ask him. He knows very well what’s the
trouble. It’s Rothe.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of short, rapid steps outside.
Vang listened, waved one arm as if with a baton to
bid the orchestra cease, and fell back, looking very
ill indeed. There was a knock, and Fru Vang
entered. She was a dark, thin, sour-looking woman
with pale cheeks and a burnt fringe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Vang sat up hastily and made the introduction
with an ease of manner acquired from habitual
attendance at ballrooms, then lay back and resumed
his invalid air.</p>

<p>“I’ve sewed that button on,” said Fru Vang,
laying something on the bed. “Don’t you think
you might try to get up now?”</p>

<p>She tripped back and forth about her husband’s
bed, settled his pillows, and pulled the sheet straight.
Her skirts were shorter than was usual, and her patent
shoes had pointed toes and very high heels.</p>

<p>The legs were undoubtedly the legs of a waitress,
but the rest of her was unimpeachable. Save,
perhaps, for the fringe.... Yes, the legs and the
fringe....</p>

<p>Egholm left the pair to themselves and hurried
home. He had gained something at least, in that
his gloomy thoughts were dispersed for the time
being. Again and again he stopped, shook his
head, and snorted with laughter, at the recollection
of huge Vang’s helpless expression.</p>

<p>After all, there was no sense in taking things too
seriously. Most of life was only fooling at the best.
He would write to the Brethren, yes; but he would
not be a fool and insist on his rights; much better
to go warily, and beg their assistance in his extremity.
It was one of the rules of the community to help any
brother in distress.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm had the pleasure of her husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
company till late that night. She looked to her work,
and he sat there as in the old days, busy with pen and
ink and quantities of paper. But he was not angry
now; he hummed and chuckled in a self-satisfied way.
At one o’clock he began to read his petition aloud.</p>

<p>The letter ought to be sent off at once, wherefore
he started off himself to the railway station,
and Fru Egholm was for once the first to retire. She
was asleep when he returned, but woke shortly after,
and was puzzled a good deal by a curious sniffling
sound that seemed to come from his pillow. Then
the bed shook, and all at once she realised that he
was laughing!</p>

<p>Ah, well, those who laugh at night may come to
weep by day, she thought to herself, with some
irritation.</p>

<p>Egholm gabbled away for some time about the
turbine, about his letter to the Brethren, and about
Vang, the trouserless, and his wife.</p>

<p>His wife.... Ah, she was a devil! A cold air
seemed to breathe from her&mdash;though she might well
have exhaled overmuch warmth in earlier days.
He remembered her mechanical smile and her soft,
gentle ministrations about her husband’s bedside.
False, false from top to toe.</p>

<p>One might almost be tempted to say that there
was but one thing genuine about her&mdash;her false
teeth! Egholm ducked down in bed again at the
thought, his lips opening and closing stickily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVI</h2>


<p class="firstpara">The Egholms managed to drag on into
December without using their stove.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm pointed to the trees in
Andreasen’s garden, showing how the leaves broke
away in the frost, and slid drowning one by one down
through the air, like naked yellowish bodies.</p>

<p>“Well, and what then?” asked her husband
uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>“Why, then&mdash;it’s winter, and time to be getting
in fuel, unless you want to perish with cold.”</p>

<p>“Why, as for that,” said Egholm, leaning over
the kitchen table to get a better view, “there’s one
tree there that’s as green as ever. Look.”</p>

<p>“Green as ever it may be,” said his wife, “seeing
it’s an evergreen. That’s holly.”</p>

<p>“Holly’s a sacred tree,” said Egholm, “and we
should take it as a model.” It was not meant in jest.
He really endeavoured to school himself to endurance.
He left one button of his coat undone, and
made long speeches about the unwarrantable luxury
of having a fire in the stove. When you went about
wrapped up in clothes, and even lived in a house,
why....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Fru Egholm sighed. She made herself and
Emanuel into bundles of clothes, and hoped for the
best.</p>

<p>At first it really seemed as if Egholm had conquered
the ancient prejudice in favour of warmth.
He talked about pawning his overcoat, and went
about rejoicing at his excellent health. He expected
to feel even better as it grew colder, he
said.</p>

<p>But cold was a strangely elusive enemy to fight
against. Out in the open, in a gale of wind, where
one might expect to find it at its worst, he could
defeat it easily, and come home flushed and warm.
Then, before he knew it, it had crushed and left
him exhausted in his own comparatively sheltered
room. His wrists grew thinner, and his fingers
curled like the fingers of a corpse.</p>

<p>One evening he gave in completely. Now he
<em>would</em> have a fire, and that at once. And since there
was nothing else in the place to burn, he cut up his
wife’s chopping-boards, tore out the stuffing from an
old straw mattress, and trampled Hedvig’s doll’s house
flat. Fru Egholm made piteous protest, but Hedvig
simply looked on with a curious smile. Next day
Egholm himself was most eager to obtain credit at
the coal merchant’s.</p>

<p>This, then, was the state of things in the house.
They had no money, and very little credit; both
difficult things to do without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>People seemed to have forgotten there was such
a thing as having their photograph taken.</p>

<p>The Egholms felt it in various ways: food and
clothing, for instance. Hedvig could manage all right
as to food. She was always eating at the baker’s,
and cakes dropped out of her clothes when she undressed
at night; she brought them home for
Emanuel. But even her existence was touched
with the ugly grey brush of poverty. Her boots
were a marvel; every schoolgirl in the town knew
Hedvig’s boots. They had an extraordinary number
of buttons up the side, with springs, and a sort of
ventilation. They must have cost a great deal at
one time. There were no soles to them now, but
that did not matter, said her father&mdash;you don’t
walk with your feet in the air! Hedvig admitted
there was something in that, and comforted herself
further with the thought that no one could see what
her under things were like.</p>

<p>There was little gaiety about the Egholms’
life.</p>

<p>And yet there was one little being whose only
longing day and night was to share their lot in every
way. This was Sivert in his smithy.</p>

<p>The day his mother had got into the train and
glided out into the morning mist, his organ of
equilibrium had suffered a shock. One day he
would fall, and fall, moreover, in the direction of
Knarreby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>He had always been keenly attached to his mother,
and, now that she was gone, his longing conjured up
her picture into this or that piece of bright metal
he held, or he would hear her voice in the blowing
of the bellows. Then he would laugh and talk out
loud, or stand up and swing his arms in a joyful
embrace towards his beloved mother.</p>

<p>Whereupon his master would immediately land
out at him from one side, and Olsen from the other,
which was perhaps the reason why he retained the
same degree of crookedness.</p>

<p>His mother had given him to understand that
there would be occasional visits; either he should
come to Knarreby, or she would come to him there,
but there came nothing more than a letter once a
month, and even these grew shorter and shorter.
At last they contained hardly more than the advice
to be a good boy and do what he was told, and not
to forget his prayers.</p>

<p>Sivert read them with quivering mouth, and
nodded; he would do as she said.</p>

<p>Then, further, the letter reported that they were
all well at home. Sivert nodded at this likewise.
But when he came to read the signature, “Your own
loving mother,” the tears began to trickle down,
and, a moment after, he was sobbing all over.</p>

<p>Each day was for the boy a ladder of a hundred
toilsome steps, and the ladder led to nights spent
with Olsen. It was getting on towards Christmas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Sivert realised it one day, as he came trotting along
through the street with a load of iron rods.</p>

<p>In one of the shop windows stood a Christmas
tree decked out with little baskets and paper horns
and cottonwool on all the branches. There was a
crowd of children in front of the window. Sivert
made a sharp turn about, and stood there lost in
admiration. Ho! That was a Christmas tree!
He knew it!</p>

<p>He was not suffered to stand there very long, for
his iron rods barred the whole footway. But for
the rest of his journey back, he talked out loud to
himself of the wonderful vision.</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a Christmas tree. Then Christmas must
be coming. It was put in the window as a sign
that Christmas would soon be here.</p>

<p>Already there was a taste of sweets in his mouth,
just as he remembered once before....</p>

<p>Then suddenly his mother’s letters, that he knew
by heart, began talking too.</p>

<p>“All well at home!”</p>

<p>At home&mdash;yes, at home ... with Mother, they
were all well.</p>

<p>An indomitable craving, and a resolution, ripened
within him.</p>

<p>His craving was that he, too, would share in
that “all well” at home. As to the resolution, he
clenched his teeth upon it for the present, and his
eyes stared fixedly. In the evening, when he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
seen Olsen go out, he stood with shaking hands up
in their room, and collected his belongings. Yes,
this was what he was going to do. He was going
home. And never come back any more. So he
must be careful not to forget a single thing.</p>

<p>There were his pictures all cut out, his letters
and&mdash;under the mattress&mdash;that indispensable tie-pin
given him by the Eriksens at his confirmation; he would
find some use for it, no doubt, when he was older.</p>

<p>And that was all. But still he wandered about
the room, looking into every corner.</p>

<p>In the washstand drawer was Olsen’s registration
book&mdash;fancy Olsen’s leaving it there! Suppose a
thief....</p>

<p>In a moment of confusion, Sivert’s hand dipped
into the drawer, closed all five fingers on the book,
and thrust it under his blouse, close against his
trembling heart.</p>

<p>Then, overcome by dizziness, he stole on all
fours down the stairs.</p>

<p>The shop windows were ablaze, and the streets
full of people. It was all like some great festival,
thought Sivert, as he trotted along in the gutter.</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck him that he might encounter
Olsen.</p>

<p>Wasn’t that Olsen coming round the corner
there? Sivert did not stay to make closer investigation,
but raced off down the first turning. And
there&mdash;Heaven preserve him!&mdash;was Olsen himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
coming out of a tavern not ten paces away. It <em>was</em>
Olsen this time. Leaning up against the railing just
as Olsen always did. Sivert turned round and fled,
as if the lightnings of retribution were at his heels,
dodging in a zigzag through a maze of intercrossing
streets.</p>

<p>He came into quarters of the town where he had
never been before, and met four more Olsens on
his way. Once with a girl on his arm, once in the
very gateway where he was hiding in fear of&mdash;yes,
of that same Olsen.</p>

<p>At last he found the road he sought&mdash;the road
to Knarreby. The distance between the houses increased,
and the gale rose to a hurricane. It was
full in his face now, and beating against his cheeks
with a torrent of sand and stones, but he bent forward
and drew his cap down over his eyes, sighting
at the next lamp-post through the split between
the peak and the cloth top, and keeping his hands
behind his back.</p>

<p>Yes, he would manage it now!</p>

<p>Then suddenly there were no more lamp-posts
to go by. The last one shed its gleam a few yards
round, a solitary figure of a lamp, the extreme outpost,
rattling its glass with a noise as of chattering
teeth in the cold, and its flame hopping from the
wick at every gust. Sivert set his back against it&mdash;he
dared not give himself up entirely to the gaping
jaws of the black dark ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew the place well, by the way; he had stood
here many a Sunday afternoon, staring out towards
Knarreby. The tears welled up chokingly within
him now.</p>

<p>A little later, there came a man with a pole.
He growled out something or other, but Sivert drew
away shyly out of the ring of light.</p>

<p>Well, well, the man put out the lamp, and turned
in towards the town again, leaving darkness behind
him as he went.</p>

<p>Sivert stole on behind him, sobbing. The
putting out of the lamps entered into his consciousness
as a picture of his own desolation.</p>

<p>Late that night he squeezed himself up in the
doorway of the old home in Nedergade, where he had
not been since his mother left.</p>

<p>The gloomy place had something of homeliness
about it; almost instinctively he stole in through
the door to the washing cellar. There were tubs
lying about, full of washing left to soak.</p>

<p>He stumbled in amongst them, and took a drink
of water from the tap, not so much from thirst, but
more from a fancy to use his familiar knowledge of
the place. Then he recollected that it made a
buzzing sound in the tenements upstairs when that
tap was turned on, and he hurried away to the passage
between the coal cellars. Egholms’ cellar used to be
the fifth. Could he manage now to tear open the
padlock with a smart twist? Wonderful&mdash;it was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
easy as ever! That showed that God was with him
after all. Full of thankfulness, Sivert slipped into the
narrow space, and tried to concentrate his mind on
the Lord’s Prayer, but fell asleep despite his efforts,
and did not wake until the pale light of morning
came filtering in to him through the cobwebbed
windows. His back was like a boil from the knobs
and points of the firewood he had been lying on.</p>

<p>Out in the washing cellars someone was rattling
tubs and buckets, and the water was running.</p>

<p>Sivert pressed himself closer up in a corner. He
stood there a long time, till his sense was dulled.
There was a bottle in the window, that looked as if it
had been used for oil. A cork was stuck half-way
down the neck. And from among the broken lumps
of peat and turf on the floor a lump of old iron pipe
was sticking out.</p>

<p>Sivert looked at the two things&mdash;first one, then
the other, a hundred times. Bottle&mdash;iron pipe&mdash;iron
pipe&mdash;bottle. He thrust out his wooden shoe
and kicked at the pipe to make a change. There was
a brass tap on it. It emerged from the litter on the
floor like a revelation.</p>

<p>“Father’s big tap,” he burst out in wondering
recognition. They must have forgotten it. No,
not forgotten; it had been left here for him to
take with him.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was clattering along at a
sharp trot out of the town, with the tap under his coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The poplars stood in two endless rows with their
leafless branches pointing stiffly heavenwards. Only
one thing to do now&mdash;get along as fast as he could.
His heart might hop and thump as it pleased, like a
dry nut in its shell; he had no use for that now&mdash;only
for his legs.</p>

<p>Villages showed up ahead of him and faded away
behind, all nothing to do with him. It did not enter
his head to ask for food anywhere, or even to rest.
Only go on, on, along the road, past ditches where
the snow lay streaked with wind-borne dust, and
tufts of withered grass above; past flattened heaps
of road-metal that lay like so many nameless graves.
Trotting or dragging his feet, he went on past buzzing
telegraph poles, passing or following heavy-laden
milk-carts or solitary peasants with kerchiefs
bound over their ears as a protection from the biting
cold.</p>

<p>He spoke to no one until evening was drawing on;
then, an old woman told him there was but another
mile to Knarreby.</p>

<p>This came to him as something of a shock; he
felt there ought to be, say, four or six miles more
yet.</p>

<p>He slackened his pace, and at the same time his
mind began working again.</p>

<p>All the way till now, through those twenty-four
icy miles, he had had a feeling that he was running
straight into his mother’s welcoming arms. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the picture changed incomprehensibly. Her open
arms were turned to clenched fists, and her gentle
eyes gave place to his father’s glaring fiery orbs.
After all, perhaps it was not so simple a matter to run
away from one’s place and go home!</p>

<p>Thrashings, even kicks, he knew, but how should
he ever be able to bear his father’s thundering voice
when he was angry? Sivert remembered how he
had once himself offered his father a brass ladle to
beat him with, just to get it over. His father had
taken it&mdash;yes&mdash;and there were dints in it still. Oh,
his father’s voice was the most terrible thing in the
world. It was not thick like Olsen’s, or whinnying
like the smith’s, but a sort of voice that made one feel
stiff all over.</p>

<p>By the time he reached Knarreby Mill it was
pitch dark. The high invisible sails flung rattling
round past a little red window far above. A little
later, and the town itself blinked out to meet him,
but it was some time before he managed, with the
help of a lad of his own age, to find the way in through
Andreasen’s yard, and stood, with beating heart,
looking in at the light behind the familiar green
curtains. Someone was standing outside the window,
looking in from one side where the curtain was folded.
Someone in a blue blouse, only a little bigger than
Sivert himself. He did not look so very dangerous....
When Sivert crept nearer, the other started, as
if to run away, but judging Sivert to be equally harmless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he thought better of it, and soon the two had
come to a whispered understanding.</p>

<p>The figure in the blue blouse was called Marinus.
Yes, and Sivert could stand there by the other
window, if he liked, and look in, if he kept quite
still.</p>

<p>Inside, was Mother&mdash;yes, his mother&mdash;sitting over
her work, making up hair. Her practised fingers
took up the piece, plaited it into the three strands,
thrust it into place, and then, wetting her fingers,
she reached for another. She nodded now and then
as she worked. And the lamp was reflected upside
down in her spectacles.</p>

<p>Sivert began sniffing and swallowing something
in his throat. Then he tore himself away from that
picture, and perceived his father sitting in a big
arm-chair, his fingers twined into his beard, reading
the Bible. Now he turned a page; now he lifted
his eyes from the book and fixed something or other
in space, nailing it, as it were, to the ceiling with his
glance.</p>

<p>On the settee in the room behind, the light from
the lamp shone on Emanuel’s fair round head, and
by the door sat Hedvig, undressed, combing her
hair. She had drawn one leg up under her, and
leaned back dreamily. A feeling of envy stole over
Sivert at sight of those legs, so thick and overfed
they seemed, both here and there. And both legs,
too&mdash;oh, it was not fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly, all well at home.</p>

<p>His father was speaking. Hedvig answered, but
with lips tight and straight as a line, though her
nose moved.</p>

<p>“Won’t?” cried her father. “You disobedient
little devil! To bed with you this instant!”</p>

<p>He slapped down the Bible on the table and
shook his hand in the air.</p>

<p>“That’s Father’s voice; I know it. I know it’s
the right one,” muttered Sivert. His legs carried
him staggering out through the gateway again, and
Marinus turned and watched him as he went.</p>

<p>After much aimless wandering, Sivert found
his way at last into the waiting-room of the railway
station. It was naturally his last resource,
being the only place that showed a light still
burning.</p>

<p>His wooden shoes echoed in the empty room, but
no one came to turn him out. He slept close to a
lovely warm stove, and heard trains rushing past,
doors opening and slamming through his sleep; not
till next morning did anyone disturb him, and then
it was an old peasant who slipped the boy’s feet
down to make room for himself on the bench. There
were a number of other people about.</p>

<p>One or two men in heavy travelling cloaks walked
up and down, rubbing their hands for warmth. A
waitress with beautiful frills at her throat had appeared;
she took down the shutters from the buffet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and set out dishes of refreshments. A little later
came the popping of corks.</p>

<p>Vehicles rolled up outside; and drivers with
silver-tasseled hats came in and hung over the bar.
They talked with noisy humour of the waitress, who,
they declared, looked as if she had not slept well
that night. The lady in question, however, merely
raised her eyebrows to show that she had not even
heard what they said. Now and again she scratched
her hair with the least little touch of one fourth
finger. Sivert understood this as evidence that so
elegant a being had little need to scratch at all.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a morning rich in experience
for Sivert. When the trains and the passengers had
gone, the head-scratching waitress sat down to
further cups of coffee. Sivert shifted a little closer,
and saw how deliciously ready to hand were the
dishes of <i>smørrebrød</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> whereat his mouth watered
quite literally, down his blouse.</p>

<p>“Are you going by train?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sivert, dismayed at being noticed.
Doubtless he would be turned out at once.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, then?” said the waitress
after a pause. She was taking her hair down, and
undoing the plaits.</p>

<p>What was he doing? Heaven only knew!</p>

<p>“Taking home the big tap. For Father,” he
stammered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>The lady laughed&mdash;it sounded like a scream. A
moment after she was serious again, but anyhow, she
<em>had</em> laughed. She was sitting now, bending forward,
combing her back hair upward and forward in little
jerks, and observing the effect in a little round
mirror with an advertisement on the back. She
laughed, though it evidently hurt badly when the
comb stuck.</p>

<p>A lovely creature, was that waitress.</p>

<p>“And who’s your father?”</p>

<p>“Egholm. I saw him eat one of those once.
Just like that.” Sivert nodded sideways towards
the dish.</p>

<p>“One of what?”</p>

<p>“One of those!” said Sivert, springing up to
the counter and pointing to a piece with slices of
sausage. “This one’s bigger, though, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Sivert could not say more; he stammered and
hiccuped in a delirium of hunger.</p>

<p>The waitress was combing back again now, till
the comb fairly crackled; she spread out her chest
mightily, and shook her mane of hair.</p>

<p>“You can have that piece, if you like,” she
said, with her mouth full of hairpins. And added
mysteriously: “Serve her right, too.”</p>

<p>Three further pieces were granted Sivert on
the same grounds, of serving somebody right. He
laughed and cried and stuffed his mouth all at the
same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a funny sort of deaf-and-dumb lad, you
are. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mostly Olsen, really,” said Sivert,
fumbling at the place where the precious book was
hidden. “But I’m not all deaf and dumb. Not
quite....”</p>

<p>“Well, I said you were half a lunatic.”</p>

<p>“... Or I couldn’t sing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear you sing.” The barmaiden surveyed
her work of art in its entirety, until it seemed
as if her eyes would turn back to front in their
sockets.</p>

<p>“Well, I can, you know....” said Sivert hesitatingly.</p>

<p>The barmaid pointed to another piece&mdash;cheese it
was this time&mdash;with her little finger. Sivert pounced
on it at once.</p>

<p>Then he wiped his mouth, wrinkled up his forehead
thoughtfully, and rattled off at a furious rate:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The pretty bird upon the tree its merry notes doth sing....”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="firstpara">and all the rest of that verse. It sounded like
an Eskimo letting off a single word of a hundred
syllables or so.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t singing, not yet; I was just trying
if I knew all the words,” explained Sivert apologetically,
and proceeded to repeat the words “with
music.”</p>

<p>A porter and one or two others came up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
grouped themselves in an attentive half-circle about
the singing mannikin.</p>

<p>Sivert sang all the <i>smørrebrød</i> off one dish, and
then went out with the porter to a little room where
they cleaned the lamps, and here he talked of many
remarkable things, helping to clean lamps the while.
At last he brought out his brass tap, and polished
that up till it shone. Then suddenly he stole off
unobserved.</p>

<p>Down the street and across Andreasen’s yard,
walking awkwardly and shuffling like an epileptic, his
mouth running over all the time with prayers and
verses of hymns.</p>

<p>In the little entry he stood still and laid one
ear to the crack of the door, listening breathlessly.</p>

<p>Yes, there was Emanuel prattling away, and his
mother answering with a few low words.</p>

<p>Was it to be his luck to find them alone? He
listened again, with his head on one side, and heard
now another sound&mdash;a long-drawn, sucking sound,
almost like a snore, and then the rattle of a cup,
repeated at regular intervals. Ah ... now he
knew who was there besides!</p>

<p>Sivert knelt down where he stood, with his face
against the door and his hands folded piously. He
had knelt that way once before, when he had happened
to upset a lamp. So, too, Knud, the Martyr-King,
had knelt waiting for death. It was the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
thing on such occasions, and no doubt looked well.
But was his hair all right?</p>

<p>He drew forth the brass tap, and tried to make
out his own reflection swimming unsteadily in the
polished metal.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had spoken aloud. For suddenly his
father appeared in the open door. The first astonishment
in his face changed to inflamed fury, and he
swung back his boot ready for a blow.</p>

<p>Sivert, terrified, held up the brass tap like a
crucifix above his head, as if to guard.</p>

<p>His thoughts were scattered in flight like sparrows
at a shot, but some instinct came to his aid, and he
cried out in his cracked voice, echoing through the
house:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord my God, I’ve brought your brass
tap.”</p>

<p>Sivert’s ideas as to his father on earth and his
Father in heaven had always been somewhat vague;
now, they seemed fused into one.</p>

<p>The effect of his words was beyond comprehension.
The threatened kick did not fall; his
father snatched up the tap instead, and said:</p>

<p>“Wherever did you find it? I’ve been wanting
it all the time.”</p>

<p>“In the cellar,” said Sivert. “But it wasn’t me
that didn’t bring it along.”</p>

<p>And with an idiot laugh he collapsed in his
mother’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm stood by the window overlooking the
yard. He blew through the tap, and turned it
lovingly in his fingers. A great ship came throbbing
towards him and took him on board. And he
mounted up, high, high, up to the bridge.</p>

<p>“Full speed ahead! Stand by! Full speed
astern!”</p>

<p>And the ship went astern till Captain Egholm
felt the tears welling into his eyes with delight. A
little after, he went to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Sivert!”</p>

<p>A timorous “Yes” came from within.</p>

<p>“Did you really think I was God Himself?”</p>

<p>Sivert nodded.</p>

<p>His father turned on his heel and said calmly:</p>

<p>“Then you were wrong, boy, because I’m not.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVII</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Egholm went up to the station in a great
state of excitement every time a train was
due from Odense. There had come a
wondrous letter in a blue envelope from the Brethren
there&mdash;a document to the effect that the community
had voted him a gift of money. It would be delivered
in person within a few days, by Evangelist
Karlsen.</p>

<p>The letter lay on the floor, as if deposited by
mysterious means from above. And certainly no one
had heard the postman come.</p>

<p>Egholm gave thanks to God. That was a thing
which should be done to the full, and preferably a
little before the fulfilment of his prayer.</p>

<p>For the first few days he talked a great deal
about the practice he had gradually acquired in the
art of prayer. But as Karlsen still failed to appear,
he grew silent, and began going up to meet the
trains. And then at last, on the eighth day, just as
he came home tired and discouraged from the station,
there sat the Evangelist himself in the parlour.</p>

<p>He, too, looked as if some angel had brought him
on wings through the air, though, as a matter of fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
this was not the case. He explained himself that
he had come by train from Jutland.</p>

<p>Egholm forgot to take off his coat; he sat down
opposite his ancient enemy, lacking words with which
to begin. And, truth to tell, he was humiliated and
abashed after all at having to accept a gift, in view
of what had passed. What made things worse was
that the Evangelist was grown so surpassingly elegant
in his dress. No more butcher-boots&mdash;nothing like
it. Striped trousers he wore, and a smart-looking
collar and cuffs. True, the last were of indiarubber,
but still.... His moustache was simply beyond
description, and the blue-black wether-eyes glittered
like globes of lightning. Under his chair was a
handbag, undeniably new, but, of course, ... no,
of course, it couldn’t be the money in that.</p>

<p>Karlsen looked round the room, and thrust his
shoulders back, as if preparing to speak, but still he
did not seem to find the suitable “word.”</p>

<p>What was he to say? As for the gift, that could
wait a little. A sermon would hardly do either,
though he was known to be a first-rate hand at that.
Suppose he were to launch out with a suitable text?
Yes, that would be the thing!</p>

<p>Karlsen went about, so to speak, with his pockets
full of texts, which he used, now to smite the head
of an unruly disciple, now to scatter like golden
largesse among the poor. He had, too, long extracts
from Revelations, which could be flung like lassos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to entangle the ungodly, cooling draughts from the
Sermon on the Mount, and blood and fire from the
Mosaic portions of the Old Testament. But it
always took a certain degree of opposition before he
could be brought to use them.</p>

<p>Egholm asked in a very general way how the
Brotherhood was getting on.</p>

<p>“First-rate,” said Karlsen, with an absent yawn&mdash;“first-rate,”
and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Egholm could not keep away from the scene of
the crime. He stammered out:</p>

<p>“Karlsen, you mustn’t regard my attack&mdash;my
somewhat over-zealous attack, perhaps&mdash;that evening,
you know, as&mdash;as evidence of enmity towards the
Brethren. Not in the least. There was much in
the Brotherhood that I greatly appreciated. A
certain simplicity.... No; if hard words were
said, they were due to a momentary indignation
over the refusal to give me a plain, straightforward
answer to my definite question, regarding that text
in the Epistle to the Hebrews, which&mdash;at any rate
to my humble mind&mdash;expressly annuls all giving of
tithes.”</p>

<p>Karlsen gloated awhile over Egholm’s downcast
eyes and the tip of his tongue creeping over dry
lips. He wrinkled up his forehead deeply, and said,
with that crafty, ingratiating smile that was so
thoroughly his own:</p>

<p>“An answer, my dear friends&mdash;why, of course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Nothing easier. You shall have it to-day. I’ve a
big fat book here in my bag; you can read it there
to your heart’s content....”</p>

<p>“A book?...”</p>

<p>“Yes. Half a minute, I’ll show you. Six
<i>kroner’s</i> the price of it, but there’s edifying reading
for more than twice the money. Guaranteed. A
big fat book, bound cloth boards. Let me show
you.”</p>

<p>“No, no. I’ll take your word for it. No doubt
it’s excellent. But ... er ... well....”</p>

<p>It would be sheer madness to offend Karlsen
now, and send him away with the three or four
hundred <i>kroner</i>, but still, there was no sense in spending
the six <i>kroner</i> if it could be helped. Egholm
knew the book well enough himself&mdash;a rambling
translation from the English.</p>

<p>“But ... er ... well, you know, there was
nothing said about that on the night. If only they’d
given me an answer in some way or other, I’m sure
I’d never have resigned from the Brotherhood at
all.”</p>

<p>“You never did resign from the Brotherhood!”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not resigned exactly ... that is to
say....”</p>

<p>Egholm sat crushed and despairing in the arm-chair,
letting Karlsen do with him as he pleased.</p>

<p>“No, my dear good man, what possessed you to
say so? If you weren’t a disciple still, of course we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
shouldn’t have troubled to help you. Nothing to
do with us, you understand. As it is, why, we hung
up a box for you at the meeting.”</p>

<p>Egholm sighed inaudibly, and inwardly reduced
his claim to half. So they had hung up a collecting
box for him. Well, well. He knew those boxes.
There were a number of them&mdash;hung along the wall
like a row of young birds with hungrily gaping
mouths. He remembered how the Evangelist used
to draw attention to them discreetly before closing
the proceedings for each evening&mdash;quite unnecessarily,
by the way, seeing that Karlsen senior, the Angel of
the flock, stood with hand outstretched in farewell,
just where the boxes began.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear friends, we have heard the
Word, for our souls’ good, and that we can take
with us in our hearts. And, in return, let us not
forget to put something in the boxes. No one calls
upon you to give much. When each gives what he
can, it is enough. The first is for the hall, that we
may have a place to meet in; the second is for
light and firing&mdash;neither of these can be got for
nothing, my dear friends&mdash;and the third is for
myself&mdash;I need hardly remind you, my dear friends,
that I cannot live on air. The fourth is for members
of the Brotherhood in distress, and the fifth towards
the purchase of a library. Put a little in each, and
your conscience will be at ease!”</p>

<p>On tithe nights the boxes were not in evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm remembered that according to an unwritten
law it was permissible to pass by the boxes
for Brethren in distress and for the library. How
would it have been with the sixth in the row, hung
up for Egholm in the throes of poverty?</p>

<p>“Did any of them give anything?” he asked
humbly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it brought in quite a lot,” said Karlsen
comfortingly. “Quite a decent little sum. You
see”&mdash;he leaned forward confidentially and plucked
at Egholm’s coat collar, almost stupefying him with
his tobacco-laden breath&mdash;“I got the old man to
stand beside it!”</p>

<p>He gave Egholm a friendly shake, and laughed in
a spluttering shower.</p>

<p>“But there’s one condition. I may as well tell
you that first as last. The condition of your receiving
this gift is, that your wife becomes a member
of the Brotherhood. Both of you, you understand&mdash;or
no gift! For it’s her fault we’ve had all this
bother about you. Yes, I’ve found that out. She’s
from Aalborg. I know those obstinate Jutland folk!”</p>

<p>“My wife!” cried Egholm. New difficulties
towered before him at the idea, but, at the same
time, the value of the gift seemed to increase. He
sprang to his feet, and ran to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Well, there you are. Now you can talk it over
with her,” said Karlsen, with a laugh, leaning his
head back and showing the scar of his “glands” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
his ill-shaven throat. “But, look here, tell her at
the same time I’m staying till the eight o’clock
train, so you’ll have to find me a bite of something
to eat. You know what it says about us Evangelists:
we’re to have neither scrip nor staff, but
take that which is set before us.”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm was busy plaiting hair at the kitchen
table. Her husband could see from the way she
tugged at her work that she had followed the conversation
in the next room.</p>

<p>“Never as long as I live,” she said firmly.</p>

<p>A catastrophe seemed imminent, but Egholm
was so destitute of physical or moral force at the
moment that he contented himself with a threatening
gesture.</p>

<p>“And as for supper,” she went on, “wild horses
wouldn’t give us more than we’ve got, and that’s no
more than bread and dripping and a rind of cheese.”</p>

<p>“Nothing hot&mdash;not even a cup of tea?”</p>

<p>“Only the clove.”</p>

<p>“<em>Only</em> the clove! As if that wasn’t good
enough.”</p>

<p>Clove tea was one of Egholm’s minor inventions.
One day when the tea and coffee canisters were as
empty as his empty purse, he had manufactured an
aromatic beverage from cloves and hot water. He
himself drank it thereafter in quantities and with
relish, and Sivert was for a time in his good books
merely on account of the audible “Aaah!” which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
he gave when it was poured out. Fru Egholm, too,
conceded that it was certainly cheap&mdash;a packet of
cloves costing two <i>øre</i> sufficed for a whole month.
But Hedvig would not touch it.</p>

<p>“Good enough for that young humbug, yes.”</p>

<p>Once more Egholm felt his hands itching with
murderous instincts, but when the tension was at
its height, a spark flew over to some nerve of humour.
He bent down almost double, put one hand to his
mouth like a funnel, and whispered in his wife’s
ear:</p>

<p>“Sh! Remember, his father’s an Angel!”</p>

<p>The Evangelist closed his puffy eyes reflectively
for a moment when Egholm returned and stated what
was the menu for the day.</p>

<p>“H’m. I’ll stay, all the same,” he said. And
added a moment after: “If there’s eggs, I like
them hard boiled.”</p>

<p>“Hard boiled&mdash;yes, yes,” said Egholm, precisely
in the manner of a waiter, and disappeared into the
kitchen once more.</p>

<p>“I never heard the like&mdash;that rascally scamp ...
thinks we can dig up eggs out of the ground&mdash;and
that in December! Why, only to ask at the grocer’s
they’d think we were mad. Eggs, indeed! <em>Eggs&mdash;on
credit!</em> No, as long as we can get what’s barely
needful. Why....”</p>

<p>But Egholm, with great ends in view, wasted
little time in talk. He went out himself, and returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
five minutes later with a bag of eggs and a lump of
sausage, which he set down triumphantly on the
kitchen table. Thus supper was provided of a kind
to exceed Karlsen’s expectations, and set him in good
humour.</p>

<p>Both laughed, Karlsen, however, the louder,
when the host’s egg was found to be bad. As for the
clove tea, Karlsen, like Hedvig, did not find it to his
taste. He explained that he liked something with a
little more colour, his taste and smell having suffered
through smoking.</p>

<p>Then, at a suitable moment, Egholm said:</p>

<p>“My wife says she won’t come into the Brotherhood
at any price&mdash;not just at the moment, that is
to say. But perhaps later, I’ve no doubt ... that
is to say....”</p>

<p>And he waited for the answer with the sweat
standing out on his forehead.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind. Hang the condition.
We’ll leave it out.”</p>

<p>Egholm could have knelt at his feet.</p>

<p>Karlsen went on to tell of the Brotherhood and
its doings. Everything was going on first-rate. Fru
Westergaard had got dropsy, and there was every
likelihood&mdash;here Karlsen clicked his tongue in anticipation&mdash;every
likelihood of her bequeathing them a
whole heap of money. The Angel went to see her
practically every day, and, in case of need, the Prophet
from Copenhagen would come too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father’s in touch with a heap of them, you
know. By letter. He got a letter the other day
from John the Apostle. He’s in London.”</p>

<p>“John the Apostle? You don’t mean.... Is
that....”</p>

<p>“Exactly. He lives in London. Don’t you
know it’s written: ‘If he tarry till I come, what
is that to thee?’ Yes, he’ll be here all right, up
to the day of the coming again. Father’s got his
address, but he keeps himself quiet, you understand,
mostly. And Father doesn’t say where he is, but
I managed to get hold of it, all the same. I sent him
a picture post card from Veile only yesterday.”</p>

<p>Egholm ran in to borrow a pipe from Marinus.
On the way he whispered to his wife:</p>

<p>“He’s the biggest liar on earth. But if only
he’d hand over that money.... I can’t stand the
suspense. Put in a prayer meanwhile.”</p>

<p>The Evangelist puffed great clouds, and delivered
another turn or so.</p>

<p>“I’ve something to tell you, my dear friend&mdash;in
confidence, that is. <em>The Star of Bethlehem’s been
seen!</em>”</p>

<p>He bent over Egholm and stared full into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Star of Bethlehem&mdash;right over Odense,
it was.”</p>

<p>And he puffed a spurt of smoke into Egholm’s
face, his own contracting into an unconcealed grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“My father, the Angel, was standing in his office,
and he saw it. It isn’t everyone that can see it,
you know. But I could. It was the hugest star
I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>Egholm condescended to shake his head as if
deeply impressed. For the rest, his every nerve-cell
was concentrating in an effort to hypnotise Karlsen’s
hand into Karlsen’s pocket for that bundle of notes.</p>

<p>At eleven minutes past seven the Evangelist laid
down his pipe and buttoned his coat.</p>

<p>“The money! Er&mdash;you’ll excuse me, but&mdash;you’re
not forgetting ... that gift.... No hurry,
of course, not in the least....”</p>

<p>“You shall have it. I’m not forgetting it, no,”
said Karlsen, with unction. “It’s not a great sum,
but with the blessing of the Lord it may go a long
way.”</p>

<p>He drew out a leather purse with a string from
his pocket, unfastened the lace with exasperating
care, and flung out a hand with a two-<i>kroner</i>
piece.</p>

<p>“Two <i>kroner</i>! Is that&mdash;the gift? Karlsen,
you don’t mean it!” said Egholm, weeping.</p>

<p>“One <i>daler</i>, yes,” said Karlsen, laughing heartily.
But his expression changed suddenly, possibly influenced
by Egholm’s threatening look, and, resuming
his dignified manner, he went on:</p>

<p>“The gift was originally forty-two <i>kroner</i> altogether,
that being the sum found when the box was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
opened. Fru Westergaard gave thirty-five herself.
You were in her good books, my friend.”</p>

<p>Karlsen allowed himself a momentary lapse from
dignity to the extent of a single wink.</p>

<p>“The rocking-chair,” murmured Egholm reminiscently.</p>

<p>“But,” went on the Evangelist, “you owed
arrears of tithe ever since February of last year....”</p>

<p>His voice grew thick with imminent laughter.</p>

<p>“So we decided to annex the forty <i>kroner</i> for
tithes&mdash;and here’s the rest!”</p>

<p>“Decided ... who decided? When the money
was collected for me? Impossible!”</p>

<p>“The congregation agreed to it,” said Karlsen
unconcernedly. Then suddenly he dug one thumb
into his despairing brother’s ribs, uttered a sound like
the rasp of a saw, and whispered:</p>

<p>“And Fru Westergaard was there, too&mdash;my
son!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Limp and utterly dispirited, Egholm walked up
with Karlsen to the station. A strange feeling of
detachment had come over him, and the inclination
to weep that he always felt after great excitement.</p>

<p>Karlsen walked a couple of paces ahead, talking
gaily over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“What say?” queried Egholm against the wind.
The handbag with edifying works at six <i>kroner</i> cloth
boards weighed heavily in his numbed hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say, it’s a good thing we’re near the end of
the month.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Egholm. “But what d’you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Pay day, my dear man. And I can do with
it!”</p>

<p>“But I thought&mdash;I thought the work was voluntary.
It says in the Rules of the Brotherhood....”</p>

<p>“Well, what d’you expect me to live on?”</p>

<p>“Why, gifts.”</p>

<p>“Huh! A long way that’d go. About as far
as....”</p>

<p>“No, of course....” agreed Egholm meekly,
shifting the bag to his other hand.</p>

<p>“But they don’t pay me enough,” said the
Evangelist harshly. “Not by a long way. Everything’s
getting dearer, and I’ve had a lot of extra
expenses into the bargain. I helped a poor girl that
had got into trouble. A Frøken Madsen. Bought
her a cigar shop in Kerteminde; it cost an awful
sum. But she was a sort of relation&mdash;not of mine,
you understand. My wife’s people. But I count it
all the same, of course. No, they’ll have to give me
a rise. And they will, too, I know. They can’t do
without me, and that’s the end of it.”</p>

<p>They reached the station, and Karlsen took his
ticket.</p>

<p>“<em>Second</em> class, I said,” he cried, and winked at
Egholm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Came from Veile, and going back to Veile.
Life’s one long journey. Anyhow, it’s what we’re
supposed to do: go out into the world and make
converts. Know a man named Justesen in Veile?
Horse-dealer. No? Ah, he’s a man if you like!
Never troubles to ask the price when he finds a pair
to suit him. ‘Bring ’em along’&mdash;that’s all he
says.”</p>

<p>“Horse-dealers don’t go in much for religion as
a rule.”</p>

<p>“Not him&mdash;no. But his wife!” said Karlsen,
rasping again like a saw. “His wife.... Had a
wire from Justesen last evening; he’s coming home
to-day and going off again by the night train to
Hamburg. So off I go to look up my old friend
Egholm&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>“Yes....” said Egholm.</p>

<p>He stood in the waiting-room a little after the
train had gone, warming himself by the stove. Then
he shook his head and staggered off homewards.</p>

<p>Again and again he tried to reckon up how he
stood.</p>

<p>“No hope of getting to work on the boat now,”
he muttered. But, to his surprise, he found his
thoughts refused to dwell on this disaster, which
should by rights have overshadowed all else.</p>

<p>No; he could think of one thing&mdash;he was hungry.</p>

<p>For months past he had not had a decent meal,
and, though he had not realised it himself, his looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
forward to that gift from the Brotherhood had been
associated with an indomitable desire for <em>food</em>.</p>

<p>Outside his own door he stopped. The scent of
the clove tea came to greet him, and revolted him
for the first time. He turned round and walked
away again, out over the sandhills, along the quay,
and down between the warehouses.</p>

<p>The group of fishermen sighted his thin, fluttering
figure in the gloom, shook themselves, and pressed
their backs closer against the wall of the shed.</p>

<p>But Egholm found at last an old green rowing
boat among those drawn up on the beach. He
struck a match, and made sure it was the one.</p>

<p>Then he clambered up on to it, and knelt down
on the boards.</p>

<p>The wind tore his plaintive prayer to shreds, and
strewed a shower of broken, unmeaning sounds out
over the harbour and the town.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVIII</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Egholm’s God was perhaps not as generous
as might be wished, but, on the other hand,
possessed of limitless patience as a listener,
differing in this regard considerably from the children
of men. It was perhaps this which led Egholm, the
ever restless, to come again faithfully with his hopes
and his prayers, though he might have turned away
in dudgeon but a short while back.</p>

<p>It was not brain-weariness. That was an ailment
Egholm never knew. He lived, as it were,
under full sail all day and night. He rose in the
morning, swallowed his clove tea, hurried out to his
place of prayer in the woods, and came back about
dinner-time. Then he would mess about for a few
hours in the studio, while his thoughts flew all ways
at will, generally down to the beach, where he
struggled with imaginary parts of his machine in an
imaginary boat, but ready and willing to occupy
themselves with anything of any sort anywhere in the
world. Egholm felt it a wasted day when he had
not stowed away a couple of new inventions in the
warehouse of his mind. And a night that brought
him nothing but sleep and rest he counted empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and unfruitful. Better a touch of the horrors than
just nothing. For, painful as it was to have Clara
Steen’s face there before him in the dark, taking the
blows that Anna should have had, still, after all&mdash;in
the long run&mdash;one could get used to anything.
Yes.</p>

<p>True, it was no use striking Anna, but it was at
least excusable. And God never said anything about
it to him out in the woods where he prayed. More
especially since that boy had come home it was
excusable ... nay, it was a simple necessity.</p>

<p>Thus Egholm forgave his God and revenged himself
on his family.</p>

<p>His wife noticed, too, how the boy’s coming had
brought a kind of ferment into their home life. Ah,
why should it be so? There he sat, the little lad,
at her side, as simple and innocent as when he was a
child, helping her at her work. She did all she could
to make him appear a harmless and useful item about
the house. She would have liked to make him
invisible, but his father <em>saw</em> the boy to the exclusion
of all else, circled round him, shot sparks at him, and
might be found gripping him by the hair if she only
went out into the kitchen for a minute.</p>

<p>Things could not go on like this. And so one
afternoon she put on the best things she possessed,
and went out with Sivert to try and find him a
place.</p>

<p>With trembling knees she walked straight into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Lund’s smart drapery shop. After all, he couldn’t
do more than eat her. And she always went to him
for what she needed in the way of thread and material,
and that was the truth. They stood just inside the
door, waiting for other customers to be served first.
Modesty, that was the way.</p>

<p>There! Minna Lund, the daughter of the
house, coming in with coffee for the assistant. Was
there ever such a place? She set down the tray on a
step-ladder, and began pulling out drawers full of
ribbons.</p>

<p>A little princess, that was the least one could
call her&mdash;though little was hardly the word, seeing
she was half a head taller than her father. Why, she
could wind off as many yards of ribbon as she pleased,
without even asking the price.</p>

<p>And the mother, standing there, fell to weaving
a long and beautiful future for her boy in Lund’s
splendid house. Those two young people&mdash;they
would surely have an eye to each other.... And
then when Sivert’s apprenticeship was at an end,
and Lund was getting on in years, who knows....
Once they found out what a heart the boy had, surely
there’d be no one in the world they’d sooner trust
with their daughter and the shop....</p>

<p>She pressed Sivert’s hand; for here was Lund
himself right in front of her, bowing politely. He
wouldn’t eat her, no fear of that....</p>

<p>So Fru Egholm had thought of having her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
apprenticed to the business? Why, a nice idea, to
be sure....</p>

<p>Lund was a little man with a full beard, and
elegantly dressed in brand-new things, but with a
thread or a piece of fluff here and there. And his
manner was precisely the same.</p>

<p>He talked with studied ease and distinction,
flourishing the roll of material before him into a
fan as he spoke. And so thoroughly did he possess
the gift of salesmanship that a moment later Fru
Egholm was eagerly discussing with him how much
it would take for a pair of curtains.</p>

<p>“Or we’ve a rather better quality,” said Lund,
reaching for another roll. But here Fru Egholm
came to herself, and thrust Sivert forward.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I’m afraid,” said Lund kindly&mdash;he
had only forgotten the business of the apprenticeship
for a moment&mdash;“we could hardly ... you see,
we make a point of taking only boys&mdash;pupils in
the business that is&mdash;from better-class homes. The
customers demand it.”</p>

<p>“But”&mdash;the mother was ready to sink into
the ground for shame&mdash;but ... Sivert <em>was</em> from a
better-class home. Not meaning herself, of course,
but her husband. He knew all sorts of languages,
English and French and so on. And only a little
time back he’d been an assistant on the railway&mdash;why
they had his uniform coat in the house now!
Hr. Lund ought just to hear him talk and speak up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
for himself, like he did with those people from the
Public Health Committee. And as for Sivert, he
was as good and honest a lad as any could wish to
have.</p>

<p>Hr. Lund didn’t doubt it for a moment, but&mdash;er&mdash;well,
one could hardly see it, for instance, from the
way he was dressed, you know. Now, could you?
And Lund bent over the counter with a smile,
whereby his own coat was brought in close proximity
to Sivert’s blouse. He he! Still, he might just
examine the young man a little. Sivert was given
two or three smart questions, while his mother was
on the point of swooning from confusion. Then
Lund turned calmly round and took down the roll
of material before mentioned&mdash;the rather better
quality....</p>

<p>“But how about the place?” asked Fru Egholm
doubtfully. “Is he to have it?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, no. I’ve no use for him. Did you
notice he said ‘drawers’? Well, ‘knickers’ is the
proper word&mdash;at any rate, the one we use in this
establishment. A little trap of mine, you know.
He he!”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm sighed, purchased resignedly a reel
of No. 50 white, and left the shop. She and Sivert
went to many places that day&mdash;to a barber’s, to Bro,
the grocer, and at last to the editor of the <cite>Knarreby
News</cite>&mdash;only to wander home at last discouraged at a
total failure all round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, she would leave it for a day or two, and
look round.</p>

<p>“Find him a place?” asked Egholm.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;there’s places enough where they’d be
glad to have him....”</p>

<p>“That is to say, you <em>didn’t</em> find him a place?”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm was so very loth to utter that little
decisive “No.” She talked eagerly about the
Christmas sales at Bro’s and Lund’s.</p>

<p>“... And, do you know, the editor, he knew
about your plans with the machine business. He
asked a heap of things, and said you were a genius.”</p>

<p>The subject was wisely chosen. And it did draw
off attention for the moment from the matter in
hand, but then her husband lapsed into his gloomy
thoughts once more.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;we’ll never get rid of him now. Who’d
ever have him? What can you use a head like that
for, anyway? He’s little better than a lunatic. Eh?
What do you say?”</p>

<p>Here Fru Egholm suddenly appeared unwontedly
versed in the Scriptures. She answered boldly, and
with emphasis:</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one place where Sivert won’t be
set behind the rest&mdash;even if they’re ever so much of
a genius.”</p>

<p>“Eh, what&mdash;what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say: <em>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
is the Kingdom of Heaven!</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm gasped, utterly at a loss, and made no
answer.</p>

<p>Sivert slept in the little back room where
Hedvig had her couch. He lay on the floor, upon a
sort of bed of some nondescript material, and slept
in his clothes to keep warm. Nevertheless, he went
to bed with a smile on his lips. His father’s persecution
could not shatter his joy at being <em>at home</em>.
Even the blows and kicks he got beat into him the
fact that he was at home, and he took them without
complaint. Yes, all was well, everything.</p>

<p>Next morning, as Egholm was gulping down his
tea, he caught sight of Sivert’s bowed and huddled
figure slipping across the yard. Ordinarily, Sivert
stole out of his room by the window, and kept out
of the way till his father had gone out&mdash;there was
no sense in giving him the trouble of getting angry
if it could be avoided. But to-day the boy had
overslept himself.</p>

<p>Egholm reached out and rapped at the window,
at the imminent risk of breaking the glass.</p>

<p>Sivert stopped, gave a sickly smile, turned round
twice where he stood, and made towards the gate.</p>

<p>“Here, you fool!” roared his father, and Sivert
stopped again.</p>

<p>“Be quick and come in,” whispered his mother
out from the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you come? Put on your cap
and come along with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Sivert obeyed without a word.</p>

<p>Egholm held the boy close to his side, and they
marched down the path towards the beach.</p>

<p>“Go on ahead, so I can keep an eye on you,” he
commands. And Sivert walks on ahead with the
transcendent smile of the martyr-about-to-be. He
knows now he is to die, but it doesn’t matter so much,
after all. Going to drown him, he supposes, since
they are making towards the water.</p>

<p>“Know what you’ve got to do?” asks his
father.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Sivert, smiling again. And a little
after, he ventures to add: “But if&mdash;if you don’t
mind, I’d like it better if you’d take a nice soft stone
and batter my head with it. I’d die quite soon that
way....”</p>

<p>“Soft stone?” says Egholm mechanically, busy
with his own thoughts. “Nonsense. You walk
straight on; that’s all you’ve got to do.”</p>

<p>“Ah well,” sighs Sivert, breaking into a trot.
“I was only thinking, perhaps I’m not a good one
to drown, after all. I can’t swim, you know.”</p>

<p>“Who’s talking about drowning? That can wait
till to-morrow, anyway. You’re coming out with
me to a place of mine, to pray.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like that better, yes,” said Sivert.
But his voice showed only the slightest possible
change of tone.</p>

<p>They walked along the beach a long way, out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the woods. Sivert walked with an unsteady gait;
he would really rather have died after all if only
he might be left to himself for a single minute
first.... But his father drove him on like a donkey
in front. The boy’s strangeness of manner irritated
him.</p>

<p>“Walk properly, boy, and keep your mind on
godly things!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sivert, and managed to call to mind
a verse of a hymn, which he proceeded to mutter as
he went. But he still walked unsteadily, bending
spasmodically every now and then.</p>

<p>“We can stop here,” said his father, as they
reached a wooded slope, where some young pines
stood out from a thin covering of snow.</p>

<p>“Do you know the text: ‘Blessed are the poor
in spirit’? Good. We’ll say that text, and then
a prayer, that you’ll repeat after me word for word.
You understand?”</p>

<p>Then, while they were still in the preparatory
stage, kneeling opposite each other with bared heads,
something happened which destroyed at one blow all
possibility of further co-operation.</p>

<p>Under cover of his cap, held before him in his
folded hands, Sivert has managed to undo one
button....</p>

<p>Egholm hears a peculiar sound ... springs up
with a roar....</p>

<p>Off goes Sivert like a hare across the ice, unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to stop what he had already begun. It looked as if
he were spinning a thread behind him like a spider.
He had no intention of returning, however. He had
but one thought&mdash;home.</p>

<p>Egholm did not attempt to pursue. He tried to
go on with his prayer, but gave it up, and went into
the woods. He walked all the morning, and came
round by a wide detour into Knarreby about dinner-time.
But his haste was such that he passed by the
house without thought of hunger or thirst. Not till
he was in the main street did he slacken his pace, and
begin looking absently into the shop windows. They
were crammed with all manner of things&mdash;Christmas
was near. There were ducks, and these he noticed
in particular, but all the rest made one confused
medley to his eyes. Nevertheless, he went up to
the next window and gazed at it attentively, as
if mentally selecting something specially rare and
costly as a present for his love.</p>

<p>Then, at the sale department of the ironfoundry,
he came to himself again. Here at last were things
worth looking at. Right up against the glass were
lovely heavy castings, pieces of machinery, and
metal parts. Pumps of all sizes, stacks of copper and
brass tubing, taps and boiler gauges, and heaps of
nuts and bolts and screws, as if a wagon load had
been tipped down at random. Then there were
spiral coils of the most delicious lead and hempen
packing, and farther back, at the end of the shop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
stood a mail-clad army of stoves. Somehow or other,
Egholm always found comfort in the sight of masses
of cold metal. Possibly it drew off the warmth of
his over-heated brain.</p>

<p>Rothe, the ironfounder, a giant of a man, stood
on the steps calling to passers-by in greeting: “<i>Goddag,
goddag!</i>”&mdash;the words seemed to echo in the
shield-like cavity of his stomach. His great head
shone as if it were of burnished copper. Now he
caught sight of Egholm.</p>

<p>“Hey, <i>goddag, goddag</i>, Egholm! How’s the
turbine getting on?”</p>

<p>Egholm walked in and spluttered out his latest
ideas. Rothe laughed, and slapped him genially on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Henrik Vang’s full of it. Talks of nothing else
down at the hotel. But, look here&mdash;when are you
going to get it <em>done</em>? Egholm’s famous turbine....”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one or two little things I still want,”
said Egholm, walking round the shop and fingering
the items that caught his attention.</p>

<p>“What sort of things?”</p>

<p>“A boat, for instance, and a small boiler.” Egholm
mentioned these as carelessly as if it had been a
matter of a couple of waistcoat buttons. “But”&mdash;he
broke off suddenly&mdash;“what’s that thing there?”
He dragged at something in the warehouse behind.</p>

<p>“That? Oh, that’s Dr. Hoff’s old bath oven.
I’ve just sent him a new one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Egholm was still pulling the thing about, when
Rothe, who was in his best lunch-time and Christmas-time
mood, said:</p>

<p>“If it’s any good to you, bring round a barrow
and take it along.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he slapped Egholm again on the
shoulder, and took up his post again at the door,
dealing out his double-barrelled greetings: “<i>Goddag&mdash;goddag!</i>”</p>

<p>Egholm was in high spirits for quite a time over
his unexpected coup. Then, happening to catch
sight of himself in a mirror-backed window, he
started in horror to see what a ghastly figure he made.</p>

<p>Yellow and haggard, with his black beard hanging
limp and dead over his worn and stained waistcoat.
A disgusting sight.</p>

<p>Could it really be the Lord’s intention to starve
him to death?</p>

<p>The thought almost brought him to his knees;
he turned in through the churchyard gate, as to a
refuge where he could recover himself. The naked
branches of the mighty chestnuts sang in the wind,
and great heavy drops fell like tears from the roof of
the church.</p>

<p>The wind must have changed. It was thawing
now.</p>

<p>Egholm noticed that he no longer felt the biting
cold. Perhaps, after all, it was not so cruelly
meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>One end of the fire-ladder had fallen down.
Egholm seated himself on it, with his back against
the church wall. He was physically exhausted, and
his brain had hardly rested for the past twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>It generally made him feel better to come in
here for a while and look out over the landscape he
loved.</p>

<p>There at his feet lay the Custom House, its acute-angled
roof just on a level with the church foundations.
Down in the office there sat Old Poulsen at
one window and Wassermann himself at the other.
Funny thing, really, that Poulsen should be called
Old Poulsen, for the sake of the few grey hairs about
his ears&mdash;he was an infant, really, compared with
Wassermann.</p>

<p>How old could Wassermann be? Some said
eighty-eight, but, looking at his mummy-face, one
might feel more inclined to think he had stood as a
man in the prime of life, wearing his gold-braided
cap, what time Noah’s Ark had landed on Mount
Ararat, and he had come to examine the ship’s
papers.</p>

<p>Egholm gave a little grunt.</p>

<p>There was but a single vessel in the harbour&mdash;a
schooner, laid up for the winter. Its masts looked
thin and, as it were, leafless, with the sails and rigging
taken down. The boys had built themselves a snow
hut out on the ice under its bowsprit. The current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the Belt was too strong just here for the ice to
hold it altogether in check; a little farther north,
there had been a battle between the two, and the
ice had lost. Mighty sheets of it came floating down
the channel; off the mole, they packed and closed
in an angry whirl, setting their teeth in the piles,
but were torn away ruthlessly and sent on southward
again.</p>

<p>In the curve of the channel between the black
woods, the ice-floes looked like a flock of white
swans on a blue lake. The grey-green line of hills
on the Jutland side looked far away in the misty air,
though the distance was not so great but that one
could count the windows of the ferry station over
between the trees.</p>

<p>Egholm’s brain had rested for just the space of
time it took to turn his head from right to left and
back again. Now it began hammering again; he
had caught sight of a certain green-painted dinghy
down by the harbour, and that particular craft
interested him more than all the other rowing boats
in the world.</p>

<p>But&mdash;in Heaven’s name&mdash;how was he to gain
possession?</p>

<p>He rose, and went down into the coal-cellar of
the church, where he commenced to pray. His
thoughts were confused with excitement, he did not
understand his own words, and when he stood up
again, the coals came rattling down with a sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
as of scornful laughter. Could a man go to the devil
and get hold of fifty <i>kroner</i> that way?</p>

<p>Or, could not a man settle the business himself,
by his own unaided power? Why this constant
begging round?</p>

<p>Egholm walked out of the churchyard, talking to
himself, and took the road to Kongeskoven&mdash;thus
completing the whole circuit of the town and neighbourhood
for that day.</p>

<p>All his inventions, were they of no more value
when it came to the point than that he must die of
hunger? Surely there should be some appreciation
of them&mdash;at any rate, in higher quarters. He thought
of some of the more important; not mere ideas he
had busied himself with to pass the time, shaking
them out of his sleeve like a conjurer, but those that
were really worth something, say, a million.</p>

<p>As, for instance, the pair of frictionless wheels
for railway carriages&mdash;that should have meant an
income to the inventor out of every pair of wheels in
all the world, if only God had lifted a little finger to
help.</p>

<p>And then that preparation of his for turning
yellow bricks red&mdash;a profit of several <i>kroner</i> per
thousand of bricks!</p>

<p>There was Egholm’s smoke-consumer, that would
make the atmosphere of great cities as pure as the
purest sea air.</p>

<p>There was ... but, no; it was enough. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
three supreme inventions of his were in themselves
sufficient to condemn that God up there!</p>

<p>Plainly, God was not disposed to help: He kept
down genius out of sheer envy.</p>

<p>Egholm walked into the woods, beating his breast
and threatening high Heaven. Once he happened
to strike himself on the mouth, and this set his
thoughts off in an entirely new direction, where
they tore away even more furiously, and flung themselves
cascading into headlong depths.</p>

<p>The blow had reminded him of that last affair
with Anna&mdash;yesterday morning, was it, or the day
before?</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” he hissed, kicking at a root. “A
downright lie, fostered in a venomous woman’s
brain. Her nose came on to bleed, that was all.
Just an ordinary case of nose-bleeding, that happened
to come on at the same time. But, of course, she made
the most of it. I didn’t do anything worse than”&mdash;here
he lashed out with his stick&mdash;“other days, but
then she starts screaming hysterically, and there’s the
blood trickling down through her fingers. Ugly&mdash;horrible....”</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>Egholm came to a standstill in the middle of the
path, and looked round with staring eyes.</p>

<p>What was this? Was he to be haunted now, in
broad daylight? Surely it might at least have the
decency to wait till night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>No; it was here. The same old story from his
sleepless nights; the fights with Anna over again.
Every word that had been spoken between them.
And then, at the decisive moment&mdash;the loved and
detested face of Clara Steen rising up to take the
blows&mdash;Clara’s white fingers vainly trying to stop
that crimson stream.... Clara’s eyes, looking at
him....</p>

<p>“I must be ill, I think,” he murmured to himself.
“And there’s a nasty pain here in the middle of my
chest. Throbbing and throbbing like anything.
Not quite in the middle, though&mdash;no, a little to
the left.”</p>

<p>He burst out into a wild laugh and beat his forehead
with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>Not so strange, after all, that it should be more
to the left. The heart was on the left side. Ha ha!
yes, he was a witty fellow, after all!</p>

<p>But the drama was still going on before his eyes.
Oh, but he would not see it. No, no&mdash;not here in
the daytime. For the love of God, let the curtain
fall! Leave it till the night, when all sorts of things
happened anyway, beyond understanding. Here, in
the middle of the road, he could not go smashing
pictures in broad daylight. It was too much to
ask.</p>

<p>And&mdash;well, he was ready to admit, if that would
help at all, that it wasn’t just ordinary nose-bleeding.
No, Heaven help him, he had struck her with all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
force right across nose and mouth. Well, then,
now he had confessed. Wasn’t that enough?</p>

<p>Where was the sense of being an inventor and
a natural healer, if he could not find a pain-killer for
his own case?</p>

<p>Still, perhaps he might, after all. Suppose, now,
he were to make one smart cut and tear that beating
heart right out, all would be well.</p>

<p>Next moment he sawed the fancy across with a
grin. Ugh! poetic nonsense!</p>

<p>No&mdash;but there was something else&mdash;something
far better....</p>

<p>Here, close by, must be Fruedammen, the Lady
Pool, where a noble dame had once disappeared in
her bridal chariot with all eight horses. Surely it
would make things easier to get down deep into
that?</p>

<p>Aha! Good old inventor&mdash;never at a loss!</p>

<p>He hung his stick over his arm and folded his
hands.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Heavenly Father, for this once&mdash;for
just this once.”</p>

<p>Some critical self within himself marked the
words as lisping and ridiculous.</p>

<p>He ran at a stumbling trot along the ground
over the serpentine contortions of the great beech
roots. It could not be more than a minute’s walk
to the pool. But there was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>Curious, by the way, that a man should for close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on fifty years have clung to life tooth and nail, and
now, to-day, on Christmas Eve, be hurrying to get
rid of it.</p>

<p>What would they say to it all at home?</p>

<p>Would Hedvig stand up straight and stiff and say,
“A good thing, too”?</p>

<p>And Emanuel, the child of victory, what would
be his future? Ah, well, there was little victory to
be expected there, after all. No, that turbine was
the true victory child.</p>

<p>Farewell, smooth round thing, that should have
gone one day with a soft “dut-dut,” while all the
world shouted hurrah and wept at the same moment.</p>

<p>Egholm found himself weeping at the thought,
and his legs grew weak under him, but he kept up
his pace, and took a last evasive mental farewell of
Anna as he went.</p>

<p>Now, just across to the other side of the road&mdash;here
it was.</p>

<p>There was a little low seat with many initials
cut in. Egholm ran round it, swept past a thorn-bush,
tearing his face against the branches, and
stood breathing heavily on the brink of the bottomless
pool in the forest.</p>

<p>A chill shudder passed through him. His head
sank forward. A moment after he gave a queer
little laugh, shrugged his shoulders, then staggered
up to a tree and leaned against it.</p>

<p>On the farther side of the pool, a blackbird was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
rustling in the leaves; now it flew off with a long
whistling cry. It was a little past noon. Now and
again a draggled ray of sunlight slipped through the
covering of clouds, and the branches threw pale
shadows in its gleam. Only a second they remained,
then vanished again like spirits.</p>

<p>Egholm felt his knees sinking&mdash;he was deadly
tired. Then, at the sound of a cart crushing through
the wood far away, he drew himself up with a sigh
and walked off among the trees.</p>

<p>The blood began pulsing in long swells through
his veins, following on his excitement, but there
was no pain anywhere now. He had a nice strong
feeling of having been honest.</p>

<p>He murmured a few words of Sivert’s oracular
speech that had stuck in his mind:</p>

<p>“It’s ever so hard to do a thing when it’s impossible.”</p>

<p>Suppose he tried laughing a little at the whole
thing. He had hurried to the pool&mdash;and lo, the ice
was Heaven knows how many inches thick. Of
course, it was. Still, he had been honest&mdash;God was
his witness to that. It must have been the open
water of the Belt that made him forget.</p>

<p>It was evening before he found himself back,
wiping his shoes carefully and gently in the passage.
So unwontedly gentle was he, indeed, that Anna
came out in a fright with the lamp to see who was
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, heavens, is it you, Egholm? We’ve been
almost out of our wits because you didn’t come back.
Wherever have you been all day?”</p>

<p>She rubbed his wet things with a towel, and told
of the joint of pork that had come from the Christmas
Charity Committee, and the cakes that Hedvig had
brought home.</p>

<p>She rubbed away, chattering all the time, mentioning
casually what a blessing it was Sivert had got
that place with the glazier’s&mdash;to have his own room
and all. She stopped, astounded at her own boldness
in daring to utter Sivert’s name.</p>

<p>But Egholm made no sound, and she went on,
scraping the mud from his boots the while, to tell
how she had just happened to think of Nøckel, the
glazier, if he might happen to want a boy, and she
had hardly got inside the door when they said yes,
and were glad to have him.</p>

<p>“He can stay here this evening&mdash;if you like,”
said his father.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm could hardly believe her ears, and
Sivert, carefully hidden away in the pantry, fancied,
too, that there must be something queer behind it all.</p>

<p>“Don’t somehow feel like being thrashed to-day,
either,” he said, darkly reflecting.</p>

<p>So the Egholms had some sort of a Christmas,
after all. The gentler feelings flourished in every
heart. Egholm himself gave orders that Marinus
from the carpenter’s shop should be sent for, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
found him gazing longingly in through a window.
On Christmas Eve, it was a duty to entertain the
poor at one’s table, he said, if one wanted to feel
any Christmas rejoicing oneself. His wife found this
a very pretty sentiment, with the one reservation that
the principle, to her mind, was followed out to an
extreme degree in their case, since the five who were
daily entertained at their board were undeniably
poor themselves.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, she went to the window,
and with a certain awkwardness brought over the
champagne blossom and set it on a chair in the middle
of the room with a candle in front. Anyone could
see it was meant to be a Christmas tree, all ready
decked. Marinus giggled at Sivert, but Hedvig rose
of her own accord, stepped out into their midst like
an actress, and sang till the windows rattled about
sweet and joyous Christmastide.</p>

<p>“Now we ought to hand round the presents,”
said Fru Egholm to Marinus, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Egholm joined absently in the laugh. He had
a vague idea of having already received a Christmas
present that was worth something.</p>

<p>He had been given back his life.</p>

<p>And that was, after all, a thing of some importance,
if he was ever to get that turbine done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIX</h2>


<p class="firstpara">After a cruel winter came the spring at last,
offering gentle hands to all mankind. Folk
might be seen walking in the streets, hat in
hand, in gratitude and veneration towards the bright,
happy face of the sun.</p>

<p>It was much the same with the flowers; they
came forth in hosts from out of the earth, <em>saw</em> the
sun, and bowed.</p>

<p>The beech, knowing its flowers were nothing to
speak of, put on its pale green silk first thing in the
morning, and found no reason to be ashamed, but
the apple tree surpassed them all; it had to put on
its bridal dress with a blush.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm left the kitchen window open all
day long. A branch from Andreasen’s espalier, an
apple branch of all things, thrust itself up across the
opening. It was almost her property, so to speak,
that apple branch. She showed Emanuel how the
bees came flying up, whispered something sweet into
the ears of the little flower things, and were given
honeyed kisses in return before flying off again.</p>

<p>Fru Egholm did more than that for her little
boy; she got Hedvig to take him out every afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
into the meadow near by. He came home with a
chain of dandelion stalks round his neck, and one
day he even had a dead butterfly in his clammy
little fist. That day, he could hardly speak for the
wonders he had seen.</p>

<p>Spring came to Egholm, too. He had got his
boat&mdash;the very green one he had prayed for. Vang
had procured it for him, by some means unknown.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, my old and trusted friend, let
me make you a present of it. Here you are, the boat
is yours, presented by a circle of friends.”</p>

<p>And the pair overflowed in a transport of mutual
affection.</p>

<p>The boiler was already in its place, and the funnel
towered proudly above, painted a fine bold red.
The screw stuck out behind, and could revolve
when turned by hand. All looked well, so far.</p>

<p>But the turbine itself, the beating heart that was
to make the thing alive, was not yet finished.</p>

<p>Krogh, the old blacksmith, worked away at it till
his yellow drooping jaws shook. His tools were
mediæval. What a machine drill could have
managed in an afternoon, he took a week to do.
Egholm turned up his eyes to heaven, when he saw
how little had been done in twenty-four hours, but
he said nothing. The fact was, that Krogh had one
quality which rendered him more valuable than all
other blacksmiths together: he was willing to work
without seeing the money first. Moreover, his work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was good when it <em>was</em> done, and in spite of his sour
looks, he took a real interest in the project.</p>

<p>Egholm was so kindly and easy to get on with all
that spring that his wife was quite uneasy about
him at times. All the hours he could spare from his
studio&mdash;and they, alas, were not a few&mdash;he spent
down on the beach, scraping and patching and
painting his wonderful creation.</p>

<p>At home, he would sit dreaming in the arm-chair,
so far removed from all reality that Emanuel might
sing and prattle as much as he pleased without
being stopped by a peremptory order from his
father.</p>

<p>He was sitting thus one evening towards the end
of May; both Emanuel and Hedvig were asleep.
The day had been hot, and the heat still hung in the
low-ceiled rooms. The children were tossing restlessly
in their beds. If only one dared to open a
window&mdash;but no; the night air was a thing to be
careful about, while there were children in the place,
thought Fru Egholm to herself. It was late, very
late, but what did that matter, as long as there was
oil enough in the lamp?</p>

<p>“Whatever are you sitting there thinking about?”
she asked, when the silence had lasted an eternity.
There was not the slightest danger now in such a
piece of familiarity on her part. Not as he had been
lately.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Egholm, drawing in his breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
as if he had just emerged from the depths of the sea.
“What’s that you’re fussing about now?”</p>

<p>“Wassermann’s wig. Look at it&mdash;it’s simply
falling to pieces. But as for a new one&mdash;well, you
should have seen his wife’s face when I spoke of it.
And if it hadn’t been that there’s a chance they
might take Hedvig as maid there, I’d never....”</p>

<p>“What d’you get for a bit of work like that?”</p>

<p>“Well, it ought to be a <i>krone</i>, but seventy-five
<i>øre</i> I will have, and that’s the least. Though I don’t
suppose she’ll offer me more than fifty, the stingy old
wretch.”</p>

<p>Egholm sat silent a while, then involuntarily he
lied a little. “I’ll tell you,” he said, “what I was
thinking about. You know that verse from ‘<cite>Adam
Homo</cite>’:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘What trouble’s worst? We’ve trials enough, Lord knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I should ask, a score of voices swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would tell me where <em>they</em> found the “little rift”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each as experience led him to suppose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One says ’tis boredom, one, ’tis married life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another finds it worse <em>without</em> a wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thinks remorsefully of sins committed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another with regret of those omitted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, of all pains we’ve suffered since the Fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will reckon <em>Money Troubles</em> worst of all.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="firstpara">Yes, money troubles&mdash;that’s the worst. Paludan
Müller, he knew. And he’s my favourite poet.
He knew everything!”</p>

<p>And Egholm fell to talking pitifully of poverty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the nightmare that had its teeth in his throat, and
could not be torn away.</p>

<p>“But there’s more comes after,” said Anna,
when he paused. “Don’t you remember the next
verse?”</p>

<p>“I know the whole thing off by heart. Anywhere
you like to choose.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you know that money troubles
aren’t the worst in the world. It’s no good losing
courage like that. And we’re getting on nicely now,
really. Etatsraaden said about the rhubarb, we
might....”</p>

<p>She put forth all her womanly arts to comfort
him, but in vain. Still she kept on&mdash;and her voice
was much the same as when she was soothing
Emanuel.</p>

<p>Egholm let her go on; yes, they were getting
on nicely now, he thought to himself, and smiled
bitterly. Oh yes, nicely, magnificently!</p>

<p>The globe of the lamp was stuck together with
strips of newspaper. Before the window hung a
piece of faded green stuff in two tapes, drooping
down to a slack fold in the middle. At the sides
were ragged, dusty curtains, into which Anna had
stuck some paper flowers.</p>

<p>On the walls were a couple of old engravings, an
embroidered newspaper-holder of his wife’s, and a
few fretwork brackets and photograph frames, these
being Sivert’s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The big mirror, too, looked ridiculous, really, at
that angle&mdash;it had to be slanted forward to an excessive
degree, owing to the lowness of the room.
Egholm could see himself in it, and the children’s
bed as well. Emanuel lay on the settee, but Hedvig’s
bed, in the little side room, consisted of three chairs.
Her coverlet was his old uniform cloak, and the
chairs rocked at every breath she drew.</p>

<p>Poverty in every corner. The very pattern of
the wallpaper was formed of holes and patches of
damp.</p>

<p>True, there were the two arm-chairs and the
chest of drawers, but....</p>

<p>His wife was still talking away of all the good
things they had to be thankful for. Of Hedvig,
coming home regularly with her good wages, and
the chance now of getting a place at ten <i>kroner</i>, at
Wassermann’s. And then Sivert, still at the glazier’s
this ever so long. Surely it was a mercy they could
be proud of their children?</p>

<p>And soon Egholm himself would have finished
that steamboat thing of his.... Fru Egholm threw
out this last by some chance, having exhausted all
other items that could reasonably be included.</p>

<p>Her husband started. It was what he had been
thinking of all the evening himself. But, anxious
not to betray the fact, he said only:</p>

<p>“Yes; if I’m lucky.”</p>

<p>But Anna saw through him all the same. Stupid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of her not to have thought before of the one thing
that was all the world to him.</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t you be lucky, I should like
to know? You haven’t lost faith in your own
invention?”</p>

<p>“It’s a curious thing,” he said, leaning back in
his chair. “One moment I believe in it, and the
next I don’t. How is it possible that the trained
experts with all modern equipment at their backs&mdash;and
money, most of all&mdash;with nothing to worry about
but their own calculations and plans&mdash;how could
they have missed the solution of the problem when
it seems to me as plain as the nose on your face?”</p>

<p>“Why, as to that, I don’t know, I’m sure. But
that steam cart you made, you know, just before
Hedvig was born, that didn’t work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s that got to do with it?” said Egholm
irritably.</p>

<p>His wife pointed warningly towards the sleeping
children. “Sh!” she said. Then, noticing that
the cloak had slipped down from Hedvig’s legs, she
hastened to tuck it up again. Egholm calmed
down.</p>

<p>“Don’t mix up a steam cart and a turbine,” he
said when she re-entered the room. “I didn’t take
any particular trouble over that steam cart&mdash;at any
rate, not enough. After all, it was only construction
work, that. But a turbine that can <em>reverse</em>&mdash;that’s
an independent invention. I’d give my heart’s blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to realise it. You know what a friction coupling is,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the thing with the two balls, that
swing round and look like an umbrella?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, no! You’re thinking of a
centrifugal regulator valve.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, well, then....”</p>

<p>No, it was no use talking to her; she muddled
up the simplest things imaginable. Egholm wrung
his hands and was silent.</p>

<p>But a little after, he looked up brightly and
suggested they should go and have a look at the
machinery now, both together.</p>

<p>Anna shook her head. What an idea!</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a bit interested in my things?”</p>

<p>“Why, that you know I am, Egholm. But you
wouldn’t ask me to go running out now in the middle
of the night. Look, it’s half-past one!”</p>

<p>“But you say you never can go out in the daytime.”</p>

<p>This was true; Anna never set foot outside the
door as long as it was light. Her dress had been
ruined altogether this winter, from having to use it
for Emanuel’s bedclothes at night. And what was
the use of having rooms across a courtyard, when
Andreasen’s workmen came running to the window
every time they heard the door?</p>

<p>“But the lamp might upset, and the house burn
down and the children in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Turn it out, then, of course. Don’t talk such
a lot.”</p>

<p>Fru Egholm writhed; there was no persuading
him any way once he had taken a thing into his
head.</p>

<p>Hesitatingly she took out a white knitted kerchief
from a drawer. She had almost forgotten what it
was like to put on one’s things to go out....</p>

<p>It was moonlight outside; the shadow of the
tall workshop roof lay coal-black over half the courtyard,
leaving the remainder white as if it had been
lime-washed.</p>

<p>Every step she took seemed new and strange.
So softly their steps fell in the thick dust as they
crossed the road.</p>

<p>Up in the old churchyard, every tree stood like
a temple of perfume in the quiet, soft night. And
all the time, she was marvelling that it really <em>was</em>
moonlight. She had not noticed it at home&mdash;doubtless
because the lamp was burning.</p>

<p>The tears came into her eyes&mdash;just such a moonlight
night it had been the time they....</p>

<p>And here she was walking with him, just as then.</p>

<p>Surely, it was enough to turn one’s head.</p>

<p>Here was Egholm actually taking her arm.
Taking her arm!...</p>

<p>Great moths and small glided silently past; one
of them vanished into the hedge as if by magic.</p>

<p>Bats showed up here and there against the pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
sky, flung about like leaves in the wind. From the
meadow came a quivering chorus of a thousand
frogs.</p>

<p>“It must be like this in Paradise,” she said faintly.</p>

<p>“Ah, wait till you can see the boat,” said her
husband.</p>

<p>The dew on the thick grass down by the beach
soaked through her boots and stockings. Moonlight
<em>and</em> stockings wet with dew.... Oh, it was
not <em>just like</em> that time now; it <em>was</em> that time ...
that night at Aalborg, after the dance at the assembly
rooms, where she had met the interesting young
photographer&mdash;the pale one, as they called him&mdash;and
let herself be tempted to go out for a walk in
the woods after. And Thea, her sister, who was
with them, had almost pinched her arm black and
blue in her excitement. But it had to be; he
was irresistible, with his foreign-looking appearance,
his silver-mounted stick, and his smartly creaking
calfskin boots.</p>

<p>He had not danced himself, by the way, but sat
majestically apart drinking his tea.</p>

<p>But how he could talk! Until one hardly knew
if it was real or all a dream....</p>

<p>It was light when she pulled off her soaking wet
stockings and her sodden dancing shoes.</p>

<p>Yes, it must be some good angel that had put
back the clock of time to-night. Here she was,
walking in the woods of Aalborg with her lover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
There was the fjord, and the moon drawing a silvery
path right to her feet. Come, come!</p>

<p>She gazed with dimmed eyes towards the wondrous
ball in the heavens, that called up tides in the seas
and in hearts; she clung trustingly to her friend’s
arm. And, glancing at him sideways, she saw that
his eyes were looking out towards it too. Yes, their
glances moved together, taking the same road out
over the gliding waters of the Belt, in through a gate
of clouds, to kneel at the full moon, that is the God
of Fools.</p>

<p>A startled bird rose at their feet and flew, the air
rushing audibly in its feathers.</p>

<p>“Listen&mdash;a lark! And singing now, though it’s
night!”</p>

<p>“A lark!” Egholm took this, too, as an omen of
good fortune for his turbine.</p>

<p>At the foot of the slope lay the boat, drawn up on
land with props against the sides.</p>

<p>He explained it all, the parts that were there and
the rest that should be added as soon as Krogh had
got the turbine finished. He spoke eagerly and disconnectedly;
none but an expert could have understood
him. But Anna kept on saying:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I can understand that, of course.
Ever so much better that way, yes. And how
prettily it’s painted, the boiler there. I thought it
would be just an old rusty stove. And the boat&mdash;why,
it’s quite a ship in itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beautiful little boat, isn’t it?” said Egholm, in
high good humour now. “And I’ve caulked it all
over. Take my word for it, the natives’ll stare a
bit when the day comes, and they see it racing away.
Let’s sit down and look at it a bit. Here, Anna, just
here.”</p>

<p>They sat down, but it was wet in the tufty
grass.</p>

<p>“We can climb up in the boat and sit there.”</p>

<p>Anna hesitated at first, but soon gave way. After
all, everything was topsy-turvy already; she hardly
knew if she were awake or dreaming. Egholm turned
up an old bucket. “Here!” and he offered his hand
like a polite cavalier and helped her up.</p>

<p>The summer night was all about them. The
lapping of the waves sounded now near, now far; it
was like delicate footsteps. For a little while neither
spoke.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;you’re not crying, Anna, dear?” He
had felt her shoulders quivering.</p>

<p>“We’ve been so far away from each other;
strangers like,” she sniffed. And then she broke
down completely. “Anna, dear,” he had said.
“Far away from each other.... I don’t see
how.... Seems to me we’ve been seeing each
other all day the same as usual.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but&mdash;we haven’t talked together for an hour
like we are now, not really, all the time we’ve been
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what should we talk about? You don’t
generally take any interest in my things. And,
besides, living as we do in a hell of poverty....”</p>

<p>“But that’s just the reason why we ought to have
helped each other. It would have made everything
easier if we had.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know.... But, anyhow, there’s
never been any difficulty on my part, I’m sure.”
Egholm spoke throughout with the same slight
touch of surprise. Really, she was getting too
unreasonable.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it now&mdash;she must say
it.</p>

<p>“You’ve struck me many a time in the two years
we’ve been living here.” She stopped in fright at
her own words, then hastened to add: “But I know
you don’t mean any harm, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you bother about it?” he said, in
the same tone as before. But a moment later,
before she could answer, he got up, reached out as if
to swing himself out of the boat, then sat down again
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Struck you?” he said plaintively. “Have I
really struck you?”</p>

<p>He did not expect an answer, but asked the same
question again, all the same. He fumbled for her
hand under her apron, and stroked it again and
again.</p>

<p>“Have I really struck you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he drew back his hand again, and shook his
head once more.</p>

<p>Anna was deeply moved. The single caress
seemed to her like the sunlight and the scent of
flowers that came in through the kitchen window in
the morning, before the others were awake. Her
heart swelled up within her, and her tears poured
down as she put her arms round him and begged him
to forget what she had said. She lost sight of the
starting-point altogether, and behaved like a penitent
sinner herself.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, do say you forgive me. Say
you’ll forget it. Oh, don’t make me miserable now
because it slipped out like that! You’re so good,
so good....”</p>

<p>White banks of mist lay over the Belt, and away
in the north-east the sun was already preparing to
emerge after the brief night. The larks rose and
fell, singing; the gulls called cheerily as they came
tearing down after food.</p>

<p>Egholm turned round several times to look back
at the boat as they walked home.</p>

<p>Quietly they stole into the house. Nothing had
gone wrong in their absence.</p>

<p>Hedvig awoke, and stared stiffly at her parents;
then she yawned and lay down again. Very soon
the chairs were rocking under her again as they
should.</p>

<p>Egholm began undressing at once; he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
tired and peaceful. But his wife whispered to say
she would be there directly; only a few more
stitches to finish the work.</p>

<p>And as she sewed, she looked with a smile at the
spots of red paint on her fingers. There, on the
left hand, was one that looked just like a ring. That
was where he had helped her up into the boat.</p>

<p>Who could sleep after a night like that?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>




<h2>XX</h2>


<p class="firstpara">Draper Lund and Barber Trane came walking
together from the direction of the town.
Reaching Egholm’s beach path, Lund broke
off in the middle of a sentence, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, I think I’ll go down this way. Enjoy
the view, you know. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Why, I was going down that way myself. It’s
to-day that thing was to start, you know&mdash;the
miracle man’s steamboat thing.”</p>

<p>“H’m. If it goes at all.” Lund straightened
his glasses and shot an unexpected glance of considerable
meaning at the other.</p>

<p>“No, no, of course. But it’s as well to know
how it went off, you know, when customers come in
and talk about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to deliver any definite judgment,”
said Lund delicately, as a very Professor of Drapery,
“but there is something about the man that leads
me to doubt. He talks so much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and so mysterious about things. And
conceited, too.”</p>

<p>“Which, with his dirty vest and frayed
trousers....” added Lund in agreement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose he’ll go sailing round with it to show
it off?”</p>

<p>“I daresay he’ll take out a patent.”</p>

<p>“Those patent things are never any good,” said
Trane energetically. He knew. He had a patent
pipe at home, that was always sour.</p>

<p>Lund and Trane stopped in surprise when they
came down to the beach and found how many others
of the townsfolk had had the same idea of going down
that way. Lund made as if to turn back, but
realised that it was too late, and laughed with great
heartiness. And those on the spot laughed again
in perfect comprehension&mdash;they had felt exactly the
same way themselves. One of them had made a long
detour round by Etatsraaden’s garden, and others
had done the same as Lund, walking smartly out as
if going a long way, and then turning off suddenly,
as if by the impulse of the moment, towards the
beach.</p>

<p>Well, <i>Herregud!</i> here they were. And, anyhow,
it was only reasonable to take what fun there might
be going these sad times. There was not much in
the way of amusement in the town.</p>

<p>Besides, it was pleasant enough, lying here in the
soft dried seaweed and the warm tickling sand. The
sun shone over the Belt and the green shores of
Jutland beyond. They could, as Lund repeated
again and again, enjoy the view.</p>

<p>He and Trane joined a group that had gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for instruction in steam engines about the person
of Lange, the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>“Then there’s a pipe goes here....” The
schoolmaster pointed to a certain spot in the air
and came to a standstill. He was very nervous
without a blackboard and his handbook of physics
to help him out. And now here were those two
unpleasant characters, Lund and Trane, lounging up
in the middle of the lesson.</p>

<p>“A pipe goes there ... and that leads to the
cylinder here....” He raised his voice and pointed
again.</p>

<p>Trane, anxious to see as much as possible, craned
his neck to follow the direction of Lange’s index
finger, but perceived, to his surprise, nothing more
tangible than the driving clouds.</p>

<p>He shook his head. How could he tell his
customers this? He gave it up, and lay down with
the others to bask in the September sunshine.</p>

<p>Egholm’s boat lay some twenty yards out; the
shallow water prevented it from coming closer in.
It was white, with a brilliant red stripe along the
side. Behind the red-leaded funnel, which was
supported with stays, could be seen curious parts of
bright metal. Egholm was on his knees, hat in hand,
puffing at the furnace. The fuel, which consisted
of half-rotten fragments of board, was not quite
dry. Now and again he lifted his head and gave a
brief glance towards land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Astonishing, such a lot of people had turned up.
He felt his responsibility towards them like a delicious
ache at his heart.</p>

<p>Oh, it would turn out all right.</p>

<p>If only he had had someone to lend a hand.
Even Sivert would have been better than nothing.
Egholm looked across reproachfully at Krogh, the
old blacksmith, who stood on the beach with his jaws
drooping as ever. He had just come down with the
last bits of the machine, but could not be persuaded
to go on board. He dared not mix with the rest,
even, for he was an accomplice in the thing, however
much he might turn up his nose to show
disapproval.</p>

<p>Well, well, he would have to manage alone.</p>

<p>What was that?&mdash;who were they lifting their hats
to suddenly?</p>

<p>Heavens, if it wasn’t the editor himself! Egholm
dropped a nut that slipped away between the bottom
boards. Perhaps, after all, Anna had not been altogether
lying when she said the editor had called him
a genius. But he would not do discredit to the name&mdash;no,
he would take care of that!</p>

<p>Trembling with emotion, Egholm watched the
mighty personage striding through the groups. He
always walked as if battling his way forward in the
teeth of a gale. Even to-day, when the water was
smooth as a mirror, his flowing cloak, his greyish-yellow
military beard, even his bushy eyebrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
seemed to stand away from him as if borne on the
wings of some private particular wind; possibly one
he had brought home with him from the battlefields
of ’64.</p>

<p>The onlookers leaped aside, like recruits, to make
way for him. His presence brought sudden encouragement
to the rest&mdash;something would surely
come of it, after all. A good thing they had not
stayed at home.</p>

<p>The editor stopped at the water’s edge, and
hailed across, with a voice rent by the storm:</p>

<p>“Egholm! Can you get done by six, so that I
can have a line in the paper?”</p>

<p>Egholm tried to rise, but slipped down again.
He was rather cramped for room.</p>

<p>“I think so, yes, I think so!” He drew out
his watch and looked at it. A quarter to nine it
showed now&mdash;as it had done for heaven knows how
long past. “I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>The editor muttered something, balanced against
a sudden gust, and marched off.</p>

<p>But there were plenty remaining. The slopes of
the beach were alive and noisy as bird-cliffs in the
nesting season.</p>

<p>How had all these people ever managed to find
their way to the spot? Egholm had not drummed
about any announcement as to time and place of his
experiment. He had, indeed, grown rather more
reticent of late. And old Krogh would hardly say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
more than he need. How could it have come
about?</p>

<p>The explanation was there in the flesh&mdash;with
a shawl about her head and beautifully varnished
clogs on her feet. The explanation was Madam
Hermansen, who had the backstairs entry of every
house in Knarreby. Whatever was thrown into her
as into a sink at one place was gladly used to wash
up the coffee cups in at another. She smelt a little
of everything, like a sewer, and was as useful and as
indispensable.</p>

<p>In addition to this comprehensive occupation
for the public weal, she found time to cherish great
amorous passions for all the big fat men in the town.
She walked about, smiling and confident, from group
to group, shaking her hips at every step, and sidling
round people like a horse preparing to kick.</p>

<p>“That leg of yours still bad?” asked little Dr.
Hoff.</p>

<p>“Yes, much the same.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Hoff, a little annoyed. “Mind
you keep it clean. That’s the only thing to do.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s no use trying an earth cure?”</p>

<p>“Earth cure? What on earth’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s just an earth cure, that’s all. It was
Egholm’s been plaguing me to try it. But he ...
well, I’m not sure his intentions are really decent like
and proper. I know how he’s been with me sometimes
... and his poor wife....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s he want you to do with the leg?” asked
Hoff, his eyes glittering behind his glasses.</p>

<p>“Why, as sure as I’m alive, he wants me to bury
it in the ground.” Madam Hermansen laughed
alarmingly.</p>

<p>“Now, does he mean? While it’s on you, that
is?” Hoff blinked again.</p>

<p>“Now, this moment, if he could get me to do it.
And then sit there for a week, for the juices of the
earth to work a cure, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Well, mind you don’t take root,” said Hoff.
His face was immobile, save for his eyes.</p>

<p>“What? Yes, and then all the worms and rats
and things.... But how he can talk, that Egholm.
Never knew such a man.”</p>

<p>Wassermann from the Customs House came down
too, his galoshes leaving a long dragging trail in the
dry sand. Under the gold-braided cap his red
wig stuck out, stiff as a tuft of hay. It was said he
had inherited it from his father. Be that as it may,
he certainly kept it in use, wore it at all times, and
stayed religiously at home while it was being mended
once a year by Fru Egholm. His features seemed
erased, with the exception of his mouth, which
appeared as a black cavity like a rat’s hole in a white-washed
wall. He stood for some minutes gaping over
towards Egholm’s boat, then he shambled on again.
His moribund perceptions had had their touch of
excitement, and that sufficed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Henrik Vang had settled himself almost as in a
cave, half-way up the slope between two willow
bushes. Sivert, who had likewise succumbed to
the prevalent fever, and run off from his glazier work
in the middle of a day, had brought him down a
whole case of beer. The boy had run so fast with
the barrow that half the bottles were broken.</p>

<p>“No harm done as far as I’m concerned,” said
Vang solemnly as a funeral oration. “But it is a
pity to waste good beer.”</p>

<p>The onlookers of the better class came up to
him one by one, to shake hands and dispose of a
bottle of beer, as quietly as might be.</p>

<p>“Why the devil can’t you come over to the
rest of us?” said Rothe, who was dressed in his
best, having just come from a meeting of the town
council.</p>

<p>“Not such a fool. This is not the only place
where there’s any shade to cool the beer.” Vang
pointed under one of the bushes. “Look there&mdash;might
be in the garden of Eden.”</p>

<p>Henrik Vang himself was perspiring profusely,
out of anxiety on his friend Egholm’s behalf.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful? Just look out there, and
see it’s really true. There’s the boat&mdash;the steamer
he’s invented. Now, if I live to be a hundred”&mdash;here
he glanced darkly at Rothe&mdash;“if I lived to be
<em>two</em> hundred, I could never invent a steamboat.
Not me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’ve been steamboats before, I fancy,” said
Rothe.</p>

<p>“Eh, what?” Vang looked up sharply, and was
for a moment at a loss; then he laughed, and waved
Rothe aside with his broad paw. “Oh yes, those
great big unwieldy things, I know. Any fool can
make a thing like that. But a <em>little</em> steamboat&mdash;that’s
another thing!”</p>

<p>He caught sight of Sivert lying flat in the grass,
dividing his attention equally between his father’s
manœuvres with the machinery and Vang’s operations
with the bottles.</p>

<p>“Come up here, boy!” cried Vang, and Sivert
crawled nearer. He dared not let himself be seen,
least of all by his father.</p>

<p>“How does he do it?” Vang looked sternly,
but with unsteady gaze, at the boy. “You ought
to know. How does your father manage it&mdash;inventing
things and all that?”</p>

<p>“Like this!” said Sivert, without a moment’s
hesitation, shaking his woolly head from side to side
like a rattle.</p>

<p>“The devil he does!”</p>

<p>“But it was me that invented the big brass tap
in the cellar, though. But then it was a very little
one, really. I don’t think it was bigger than there
to there,” said Sivert modestly, indicating a length
of Vang’s leg from the ankle to the middle of the
thigh. “Look how it’s puffing now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The smoke was pouring out violently from the
funnel of the boat, drifting in towards the onlookers
as a foretaste of what was to come. Egholm was
working away feverishly. Now he was seen clambering
barefooted, with his trousers rolled up to the
knee, out past the engine to the bow; a moment
later, he was back in the stern, leaning over with
his sleeves in the water up to the elbows, turning at
the screw, or baling out water as frantically as if in
peril of shipwreck.</p>

<p>Folk whispered to one another; now he was
doing so-and-so....</p>

<p>But&mdash;what was this? Here was Egholm’s girl
Hedvig coming down, with the youngest child by
the hand&mdash;what did she want? And wearing the
famous button boots, too&mdash;the ones with ventilators
in. Emanuel had one stocking hanging in rings
about his ankle.</p>

<p>“What do <em>you</em> want?” Egholm’s nose was
smeared with soot and oil, and his brow was puckered
angrily.</p>

<p>“There’s a lady come to be taken.”</p>

<p>“Tell her to come again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Egholm gave a single proud, firm glance towards
the land. Then he bent down again over his spanner.
The matter was decided. Hedvig tossed her head,
fished up Emanuel out of the sand, and walked
off.</p>

<p>What legs the girl had! But it was really indecent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to go about like that, with her skirts cut
short above the knee.</p>

<p>“Say your father’s busy&mdash;dreadfully busy about
something just now.” Egholm consulted his dead
watch once more. “Ask if she can’t wait, say, about
an hour, and I’ll be there directly.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“Hedvig!” Egholm stood up and shouted.
“Who was the lady?”</p>

<p>“A fine lady,” said Hedvig, angry and ashamed.</p>

<p>“Ask her to sit down,” said Egholm, his voice
somewhat faint. “I’ll come directly.”</p>

<p>He thrust more fuel under the boiler, stepped
over the side, and waded ashore, with his boots in
his hand and his socks dangling out of his pockets.</p>

<p>“You’re a smart one!” said Rothe, playfully
threatening.</p>

<p>“Very annoying,” said Egholm. “But I’ll be
back in five minutes’ time.”</p>

<p>He thrust his bare feet into his boots and ran up
towards home.</p>

<p>“We may as well go,” said Lange, the schoolmaster,
looking round. “It won’t come to anything,
after all.”</p>

<p>“I’m going out to have a look at the thing, anyhow,”
said Rothe, and began pulling off his boots.</p>

<p>“I’m half a mind to myself,” said Dr. Hoff,
tripping about.</p>

<p>“Give you a ride out, Doctor?” suggested Rothe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the onlookers laughed, but the little
dark medico accepted the offer in all seriousness.</p>

<p>And suddenly quite a number decided to go out
and look for themselves.</p>

<p>Trane, the barber, and schoolmaster Lange sat down
back to back and began pulling off shoes and stockings.
Lange put his hat over the foot he bared first.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” from one and then another as they
dipped their feet. The water was cold.</p>

<p>“But surely&mdash;it looks like....” The Doctor
stood in the boat, gazing nearsightedly at the engine.
“Surely that’s the lid of my old bathroom stove&mdash;you
remember I sent it back to you?”</p>

<p>“Why, so it is!” cried Rothe. “Oho, so that
was what he wanted the old scrap-iron for.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed the funnel?” said Lange.</p>

<p>All saw at once that the funnel was a milk-can
with the button knocked out; the stays were made
fast to the handles on either side. Lange laughed,
with chattering teeth; it was abominably cold.</p>

<p>“It makes an excellent funnel, anyhow,” said the
Doctor shortly.</p>

<p>“Suppose the thing started off with us now,”
said Trane, measuring the distance to shore.</p>

<p>“We’d soon be at the bottom, in this rotten
old hulk.” Lange pointed to the water slopping
about over the bottom boards. He had in his
mind appointed Dr. Hoff head of the class, and did
not care to address himself to others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Hoff sharply. “You’d have
preferred him to start with mahogany and polished
brass.”</p>

<p>Lange turned away angrily; it was distressing
to have to set a mental black mark against the name
of his most promising pupil. But impertinence....</p>

<p>“Still, a man need not be stingy all round,” said
Trane. He was thinking of Egholm’s bald pate and
untouched beard, that rendered him independent of
all the barbers in the world.</p>

<p>“Here, Rothe,” said the Doctor. “Come and
explain the thing. How’s it supposed to work?
I’ve seen plans and drawings of that sort, of course,
but I don’t mind admitting it’s altogether beyond
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Rothe, shrugging his shoulders and
puckering his brows with a careless air, “it’s not
so easy to explain when you’re not in the business.
But, roughly, it’s like this....” And he began
setting forth briefly the principles of the turbine.</p>

<p>“And that, of course, can only go round one
way. How he’s ever managed to get it to reverse,
the Lord only knows. There’s nothing much to see
from the outside.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall hear this evening how it works.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;perhaps not. I shouldn’t be too
certain. There’s a heap of things to take into
consideration, apart from what you might call the
principle of the thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t see it, of course, but there’s
a hundred odd things. That boiler there, for instance&mdash;can
he get up a sufficient head of steam with that?
I don’t believe it. A turbine wants any amount of
steam to drive. If he got it fairly going, the thing’d
simply burst. Hark! how it’s thumping away already.
But there’s no danger as long as he’s only got that
dolls’ house grate to heat it with. And as for
the boat”&mdash;Rothe looked round to make sure
that Lange was out of hearing; the others were
limping back shiveringly to land&mdash;“the freckle-nosed
birch-and-ruler merchant’s right enough; it’s
simply falling to pieces as it is. Egholm, poor
devil, he got some odd bits of tin from my place
and patched up the worst parts, but the nails wouldn’t
hold even then.&mdash;Coming off, Doctor? Here, get
up again.&mdash;And the stuff he’s burning’s no better
than hay. He’s been stoking away for a couple of
hours now, and hasn’t got up steam yet.”</p>

<p>“What d’you reckon it would cost to make the
experiment properly?” asked the Doctor, with his
expressionless face, as they reached dry land again.</p>

<p>“Oh, any amount of money. Thousands of
<i>kroner</i>. It’s hopeless for a poor devil like him to try.
But, of course, once he could get the thing to go
once round and reverse, why, <em>he’d be a millionaire!</em>”</p>

<p>Rothe shouted out the last words to the whole
assembly; then he hopped across to Henrik Vang’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
bush. He pricked up his ears at the murmur that
arose from his words.</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen had only just discovered
Vang. Suddenly she stood at the foot of the slope
and gave an amorous laugh.</p>

<p>Vang took the bottle from his lips in the middle
of a draught, and the beer frothed over down his
vest.</p>

<p>“Get out!” he cried, with horror in his face.
“Get out!” And he threw the bottle at her.</p>

<p>Vang was a big man among his fellows; but
under Madam Hermansen’s glance he felt himself
naked and ashamed.</p>

<p>Madam Hermansen sidled away in her polished
clogs, still smiling.</p>

<p>Egholm came back at a trot, pushing an old
perambulator full of coals. He breathed in relief to
find that the crowd was still there; it had, indeed,
increased. The workmen from the factory had
come down to the beach on their way home, and
stood there now talking in bass voices, their eyes
turning ridiculously in their black faces. The
apprentice lads had come, too&mdash;unable to resist.
They felt a kind of primitive, brutally affectionate
attraction towards the boat, which for some unexplained
reason they had christened <i>The Long
Dragon</i>. It was just the right distance for a stone-throwing
target, and gave a delightful metallic
sound when hit. They had used it as a bathing-station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
while the weather was still warm, undressing
in it, diving in from it, and rocking it in the water
till the waves washed up on the sand. They heaved
up the anchoring stones, and sailed out with it,
shouting and singing, into deep water, where
they swam round it in flocks, like grampus
about a whale. They turned the screw and made
bonfires under the boiler. But they did more: they
laid an oar across from gunwale to gunwale, and
danced on it to see if it would break. And found it
did. They threw the manometer into the water to
see if it would float. And found it didn’t. A pale
youngster, the son of Worms, the brewer, who was
not a factory apprentice at all, but a fine gentleman
in the uniform of the Academy, found a pot of paint
under one of the seats, and promptly painted his
name, <i>Cornelius</i>, in red on the side of the boat.</p>

<p>This was not done merely in jest, but by way of
revenge for a nasty jagged cut he had sustained when
making his first investigations.</p>

<p>Egholm waged a continual hopeless war against
those boys. It was rarely that he encountered them
himself, but he found their traces frequently. When
he did happen to catch one, it always turned out to
be an innocent, who did not even know the others
of the band.</p>

<p>This evening, however, in the presence of so many
respectable citizens, the boys stood with hunched-up
shoulders and hands in their pockets, silent, or speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>ing
only in whispers. Now and again they nudged
one another, like owls on a beam in the church
tower.</p>

<p>The fire was being fed properly now, with coal,
sending out a cloud of smoke like a waving velvet
banner. There was a rasp of filing and sharp strokes
of a hammer; the sound of iron against iron. Then
down came a compositor boy with the editor’s
compliments, and....</p>

<p>“You can tell him I guarantee the machine will
work all right. I <em>guarantee</em> it&mdash;you understand.
And....”</p>

<p>“Then it hasn’t gone yet?”</p>

<p>“But you can see for yourself,” cried Egholm
in despair; “the pressure’s there all right now.”
And, to prove it, he sprang up and pulled at the little
steam whistle. It gave a shriek as if to call for help&mdash;then
died away.</p>

<p>“Hark at the cock-crow!” shouted Sivert, beside
himself. “The world-famous cock crowing.”</p>

<p>“What’s that he’s shouting about?”</p>

<p>No one had understood the words. But they
saw the boy dancing on the crest of a hill with his
white curls whirling about his head, and the enthusiasm
laid hold on them, too. They leaped up
from their mounds of seaweed, and in the dusk it
seemed to them as if the boat moved. There was a
tickling in their throats. Vang was weeping copiously
already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give him a cheer,” said the doctor, moving
from group to group. The doctor with his glasses
was not to be contradicted.</p>

<p>They filled their lungs with air ready for a shout;
then up came Petrea Bisserup, dragging her father
along, and that air was expended in laughter.</p>

<p>Bisserup was a blind brushmaker, who lived in a
little white house on the outskirts of the town. He
was a little grey man, with a felt hat several sizes too
large, and his face so covered with a fungus-growth
of beard that only his nose showed through. His
daughter, who led him, had a crooked neck, which
bent over so far as to leave her head lying archly on
one shoulder; she was a woman grown, but wore
short skirts and cloth shoes. They were a remarkable
pair, and in face of this counter-attraction,
Egholm’s wonder-boat might have sailed away to
Jutland without being noticed by the crowd.</p>

<p>“Ei, ei.... Anything hereabout for a blind
man to see?”</p>

<p>The boys from the factory could contain themselves
no longer; one of them barged another over
against the old man, while the rest chuckled and
cackled and quacked like a yard full of mixed poultry.</p>

<p>“Petrea&mdash;here, Petrea, what are you looking at?”</p>

<p>“Little devils!” said Trane, gloating over them
all the same. Lund, the scientific draper, laughed
too, but schoolmaster Lange, recollecting his lessons
at the drawing school, shrank back a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Petrea strode untroubled through the crowd, her
mouth hanging open, and the old man trailing behind
at her skirts like some uncouth goblin child. His
moleskin breeches were of enormous capacity; the
seat hung down behind to his calves. When he
stood still, the superfluous folds fluttered in the wind
like a rag-and-patch tent at a fair.</p>

<p>“Is’t that way there, Petrea?” He pointed
with his stick, and leant over, listening.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk. Folk were beginning to
shiver a little in the evening air. And there was
nothing amusing after all in the sight of these two
poor vagrants. What was the time?</p>

<p>When Egholm opened the furnace door, the
column of smoke shone like gold, and his face glowed
fantastically big and red. Still a few more degrees
were needed on the manometer&mdash;just a few. He
stoked away, till the sparks flew like shooting stars
across the sky. A fever seized him; he threw on
coal with his bare hands, and found himself grasping
with all ten fingers at a single lump.</p>

<p>Every second he glanced over at the shore, though
it was impossible to distinguish anything clearly
now.</p>

<p>Trembling, he heard a burst of laughter, that
rolled like a wave along the line.</p>

<p>“Look straight ahead, Petrea, pretty Petrea,
do!”</p>

<p>Heaven be thanked&mdash;they were not laughing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
him, after all. If only the coals had been a little
better. But it was dust and refuse, every handful.</p>

<p>“Is Dr. Hoff here?” someone cried.</p>

<p>“Who’s asking for <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“There’s a cart from the country.”</p>

<p>The doctor cast a final glance at the water,
where the glow from the fire played like a shoal
of red fish; then he walked away with little hurried
steps.</p>

<p>“I’m off,” said Lange. “I don’t see what there
is to stand about here for.”</p>

<p>What was there to stand about there for? No
one could find any satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>It was dark and cold, and wife and supper were
waiting at home.</p>

<p>The crowd broke up in little groups by common
instinct. Lund and Trane went. The workmen
from the factory went. All of them together.</p>

<p>Over between the two bushes Rothe was giving
orders in a low voice. It was Henrik Vang being
lifted on to a wheelbarrow. Sivert and his bosom
friend, Ditlev Pløk, the cobbler’s boy, were hauling
each at one leg. When they came up to the level
road, Sivert left the work to Ditlev, and clambered
up himself beside Vang. The boy was wild with
delight, and bubbling over with laughter and
snatches of song. Madam Hermansen hurried up
after them.</p>

<p>What had they been thinking of?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Away, away! homeward; see, the lights were
lit already in the town.</p>

<p>The factory boys whistled like rockets, and
marched in procession two and two about Petrea
and her father.</p>

<p>The respectable citizens stepped out briskly to
get warm, and laughed modestly one to another, like
peasants emerging from a conjurer’s tent.</p>

<p>But never again!</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps died away on the path,
and the last of the figures disappeared into the gloom,
leaving a solitary figure still waiting on the beach&mdash;a
little woman, shivering under a white knitted
kerchief. It was Fru Egholm. No one had seen her
come; she sat as if under a spell, watching the
myriad sparks that rose in curves against the evening
sky, to fall and expire in the sand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXI</h2>


<p class="firstpara">A few weeks have passed. It is just after
dawn.</p>

<p>Up on the beach, Egholm and Sivert are
toiling away till their feet are buried in the sand,
hauling away at a rope that runs through a square-cut
block to the boat. They bend forward and tug
till their faces are fiery red. Then at last the <i>Long
Dragon</i> yields and scrapes slowly up over the stones
on to the sand. There it lies, like a newly caught
fish, with a growth of shell and weed under its
belly.</p>

<p>“Now&mdash;up with her! Put your shoulder to it,
slave! That’s it! Now up and bale her out.”</p>

<p>Sivert had discovered that the water drained out
of the boat from one of the tin patches, and found
therefore no need to hurry, but followed with greater
interest his father’s operations. Egholm clambered
up the slope, vanished between two bushes, and came
down again laden with a sack bigger than himself.
It was evidently light in proportion to its bulk,
since it could be carried by one hand. In the other
he held a bottle.</p>

<p>Up to now, Sivert had seen only his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
usual harsh look, but as he came down to the boat
this time his expression changed to a great smile.</p>

<p>“Now for a grand burnt-offering, boy! The
biggest that ever was since the days of Abraham and
Isaac. No; stay where you are. I’m not going to
sacrifice you; <em>that</em> wouldn’t be much of a sacrifice,
anyway. It’s the boat&mdash;the turbine. Bale away;
we must have it thoroughly dry.”</p>

<p>Sivert splashed about with the dipper, and his
father, still smiling, opened the sack. It was full
of shavings.</p>

<p>“A sacrifice and a burnt-offering to the Lord.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it work, then&mdash;the brass tap?”</p>

<p>“The turbine, you mean? Work and work,
why....” Egholm shrugged his shoulders. “Oh
yes, it worked all right. <em>My</em> calculations were
right enough. Couldn’t be wrong. But <em>the Lord</em>
wouldn’t have it. Didn’t suit Him to let my little
invention come out just now, and so”&mdash;again a
mighty shrug of the shoulders&mdash;“so, of course, I gave
it up. I think she’ll do now.”</p>

<p>He began tearing out handfuls of shavings and
spreading them over the boat fore and aft; they
filled up beautifully now they were loose.</p>

<p>“No,” he went on; “God wouldn’t have it. I
felt it while I was stoking the fire that day. The
pressure wouldn’t come as it should, though I’d
brought down a whole perambulator full of coal.
Then at last, when He sent away the crowd that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
come to see, I understood&mdash;I understood that He
was jealous of my triumph and wouldn’t have it.
Well, He can have it now.”</p>

<p>Sivert kept carefully to the opposite side of the
boat, away from his father. It was safer, he felt,
in case.... For, despite the smile, it was evident
that his father was in a highly excited state. He
did not scruple to walk round from one side to the
other through the water, with his boots and socks
on, though the waves splashed up over his knees.
Sivert felt it would have been better to go round
the other end of the boat, on dry land. At any rate,
he preferred that way himself.</p>

<p>Now for the bottle. Egholm waved it generously,
sprinkling the paraffin over the shavings and woodwork.
Sivert, too, began to find it amusing. Paraffin
and shavings&mdash;that was the thing!</p>

<p>“Got a match?”</p>

<p>Had he not! Sivert’s fingers had been itching
for minutes past to get at the box.</p>

<p>“Right&mdash;then fire away!”</p>

<p>Sivert struck a light, but the wind blew it out
at once. He took a whole bundle in his fingers, leaned
in over the edge of the boat, and struck. They
went off like tiny shells, sputtering out on every
side, but the shavings remained as dead as the sand
of the beach. Once more he tried the same way,
and this time it seemed with better success. There
was a glow deep down among the mass. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
nothing came of it save a smouldering redness that
sent a thin white smoke out over the side. The
lowest layer of shavings must have been wetted by
the water in the bottom.</p>

<p>Egholm fired up in sudden anger.</p>

<p>“Get out of it, you Cain! Spoiling my burnt-offering!”
He grasped an oar and struck out at
the boy.</p>

<p>Sivert slipped aside unscathed, and clambered
up to the top of the slope.</p>

<p>With a couple of furious blows, Egholm struck
the oar through the rotten planks. The wind
rushed in through the opening, and next moment a
burst of flame rose several feet into the air.</p>

<p>A ship laden with flames!</p>

<p>Egholm stood as if petrified; then he began
hurriedly throwing on more combustibles. He had
a tar barrel and another huge sack of shavings,
besides a whole pile of dry driftwood.</p>

<p>The funnel stays burned through, and the funnel
blew off as a hat is torn from a man’s head.</p>

<p>The tar barrel lay on a thwart, spewing green
flame from its mouth. The sides had caught already.
Egholm took up an armful of crackling dry weed and
threw it in. As he did so, he happened to catch
sight of the little manometer, and he sprang back
in dismay. The indicator had worked round as far
as it could, and stood firmly pressed against the
stopping-pin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>God in Heaven! He had forgotten the water
in the boiler! Another second and it would
burst!</p>

<p>True, that mattered little, since the boat and all
its contents were to be sacrificed. Nevertheless,
Egholm picked up the oar and thrust it here and
there among the flames, trying to open some valve or
other. He had not reckoned on a bursting boiler,
which would be out of place, to say the least, in a
burnt-offering. He flung his coat about his face to
shield him from the flames, and stabbed blindly with
his oar.</p>

<p>Suddenly the burning boat seemed to shiver.
Egholm dropped his oar and sprang back, expecting
to see the whole thing explode....</p>

<p>When he turned round, he saw a strange sight.
The screw was revolving at a furious rate, just
touching the surface, and flinging up a hail of salt
water against the wind.</p>

<p>He stooped forward, bending low down, his
mouth agape with overwhelming astonishment.
This was more of a marvel than anything he had
seen. He had lied when he said the thing had
worked all right the first time. At any rate, he knew
nothing of how it had worked himself. He had
simply had some parts made according to his own
idea, and screwed them together. Now, he could
hear the turbine whirring round, saying dut-dut,
just as he had dreamed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>It only remained to see if it would reverse. Could
he reverse the steering-gear in all that flame and
smoke? It would have to be done swiftly&mdash;swiftly&mdash;for
in a moment the boiler would be empty.</p>

<p>He worked and wriggled away with the oar,
unheeding the fire that singed his beard and eyebrows.
When this proved fruitless, he wrapped wet
seaweed thickly round his arm and thrust it into the
flames.</p>

<p>He had found it now, though in agonising pain.
Then&mdash;the screw stood still a moment, and whirled
round the opposite way. Egholm could feel the
water spurting up towards him now. It soothed his
burns. He stood still, close up to the boat, and
wept.</p>

<p>Sivert sat up on the slope, watching it all. His
father called to him to come down.</p>

<p>“D’you see that?” he cried. Despite the grime
and the red burns, his face wore a look of supreme
exaltation. “D’you see that?”</p>

<p>“She’s puffing away finely,” Sivert admitted.</p>

<p>Just then something snapped inside, and the
engine stopped. Egholm ran for more weed to wrap
round his arm, but, before he was ready, the explosion
came. The sound was scarcely heard in the
gale, only a slight <i>pouf</i>, but it split the boat lengthways
like a ripe pea-pod.</p>

<p>Egholm looked on, delighted.</p>

<p>“D’you know what I think?” he said, cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
his martyred hand. “I think, my boy, we’ve done a
great thing to-day. We’ve made a great burnt-offering
unto the Lord. But more than that.
We’ve&mdash;yes, in a way, <em>we’ve heaped coals of fire on
His head!</em>”</p>
